TI  - Efficacy of treatments for anxiety disorders: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 183-92
LID - 10.1097/YIC.0000000000000078 [doi]
AB  - To our knowledge, no previous meta-analysis has attempted to compare the efficacy 
      of pharmacological, psychological and combined treatments for the three main 
      anxiety disorders (panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and social 
      phobia). Pre-post and treated versus control effect sizes (ES) were calculated 
      for all evaluable randomized-controlled studies (n = 234), involving 37,333 
      patients. Medications were associated with a significantly higher average 
      pre-post ES [Cohen's d = 2.02 (1.90-2.15); 28,051 patients] than psychotherapies 
      [1.22 (1.14-1.30); 6992 patients; P < 0.0001]. ES were 2.25 for 
      serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (n = 23 study arms), 2.15 for 
      benzodiazepines (n = 42), 2.09 for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (n = 
      62) and 1.83 for tricyclic antidepressants (n = 15). ES for psychotherapies were 
      mindfulness therapies, 1.56 (n = 4); relaxation, 1.36 (n = 17); individual 
      cognitive behavioural/exposure therapy (CBT), 1.30 (n = 93); group CBT, 1.22 (n = 
      18); psychodynamic therapy 1.17 (n = 5); therapies without face-to-face contact 
      (e.g. Internet therapies), 1.11 (n = 34); eye movement desensitization 
      reprocessing, 1.03 (n = 3); and interpersonal therapy 0.78 (n = 4). The ES was 
      2.12 (n = 16) for CBT/drug combinations. Exercise had an ES of 1.23 (n = 3). For 
      control groups, ES were 1.29 for placebo pills (n = 111), 0.83 for psychological 
      placebos (n = 16) and 0.20 for waitlists (n = 50). In direct comparisons with 
      control groups, all investigated drugs, except for citalopram, opipramol and 
      moclobemide, were significantly more effective than placebo. Individual CBT was 
      more effective than waiting list, psychological placebo and pill placebo. When 
      looking at the average pre-post ES, medications were more effective than 
      psychotherapies. Pre-post ES for psychotherapies did not differ from pill 
      placebos; this finding cannot be explained by heterogeneity, publication bias or 
      allegiance effects. However, the decision on whether to choose psychotherapy, 
      medications or a combination of the two should be left to the patient as drugs 
      may have side effects, interactions and contraindications.

TI  - Therapeutic strategies for social anxiety disorder: where are we now?
PG  - 1179-1189
LID - 10.1080/14737175.2019.1666713 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Classical well-established treatments of social anxiety disorder 
      (SAD) are now complemented by more recent therapeutic strategies. This review 
      aims to summarize available therapies for SAD and discuss recent evidence-based 
      findings on the management of this disorder.Areas covered: Recent guidelines 
      recommend psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and 
      pharmacotherapy, as first-line treatments of patients with SAD, without a clear 
      superiority of one option over the other. CBT includes classical approaches such 
      as in vivo exposure to social situations and cognitive therapy, but new 
      modalities and techniques have been recently developed: third-wave approaches, 
      internet-delivered therapy, virtual reality exposure, and cognitive bias 
      modification. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and 
      serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors have been also extensively studied 
      and shown to be effective in SAD. Two alternative strategies have been developed 
      to treat SAD with disappointing results: cognitive bias modification, and 
      pharmacological augmentation of psychotherapy using D-cycloserine during exposure 
      sessions.Expert opinion: Personalized treatments for SAD patients are now 
      available. Innovative strategies such as online psychotherapy and virtual reality 
      exposure are useful alternatives to CBT and SSRIs. Future developments and 
      optimization of attention bias modification and of pharmacological augmentation 
      of psychotherapy can be promising.

TI  - Comparative Effectiveness and Safety of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and 
      Pharmacotherapy for Childhood Anxiety Disorders: A Systematic Review and 
      Meta-analysis.
PG  - 1049-1056
LID - 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2017.3036 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Childhood anxiety is common. Multiple treatment options are 
      available, but existing guidelines provide inconsistent advice on which treatment 
      to use. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness and adverse events 
      of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy for childhood anxiety 
      disorders. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central 
      Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and 
      SciVerse Scopus from database inception through February 1, 2017. STUDY 
      SELECTION: Randomized and nonrandomized comparative studies that enrolled 
      children and adolescents with confirmed diagnoses of panic disorder, social 
      anxiety disorder, specific phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, or separation 
      anxiety and who received CBT, pharmacotherapy, or the combination. DATA 
      EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Independent reviewers selected studies and extracted 
      data. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Primary anxiety symptoms (measured by child, parent, or clinician), 
      remission, response, and adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 7719 patients were 
      included from 115 studies. Of these, 4290 (55.6%) were female, and the mean 
      (range) age was 9.2 (5.4-16.1) years. Compared with pill placebo, selective 
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) significantly reduced primary anxiety 
      symptoms and increased remission (relative risk, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.37-3.04) and 
      response (relative risk, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.60-2.40). Serotonin-norepinephrine 
      reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) significantly reduced clinician-reported primary 
      anxiety symptoms. Benzodiazepines and tricyclics were not found to significantly 
      reduce anxiety symptoms. When CBT was compared with wait-listing/no treatment, 
      CBT significantly improved primary anxiety symptoms, remission, and response. 
      Cognitive behavioral therapy reduced primary anxiety symptoms more than 
      fluoxetine and improved remission more than sertraline. The combination of 
      sertraline and CBT significantly reduced clinician-reported primary anxiety 
      symptoms and response more than either treatment alone. Head-to-head comparisons 
      were sparse, and network meta-analysis estimates were imprecise. Adverse events 
      were common with medications but not with CBT and were not severe. Studies were 
      too small or too short to assess suicidality with SSRIs or SNRIs. One trial 
      showed a statistically nonsignificant increase in suicidal ideation with 
      venlafaxine. Cognitive behavioral therapy was associated with fewer dropouts than 
      pill placebo or medications. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Evidence supports the 
      effectiveness of CBT and SSRIs for reducing childhood anxiety symptoms. 
      Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors also appear to be effective based on 
      less consistent evidence. Head-to-head comparisons between various medications 
      and comparisons with CBT represent a need for research in the field.

TI  - Efficacy of Hypnosis on Dental Anxiety and Phobia: A Systematic Review and 
      Meta-Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci12050521 [doi]
LID - 521
AB  - Hypnosis is a commonly used therapy option in dentistry and medicine for fear and 
      pain reduction. Nevertheless, it is viewed very critically, as there is still 
      insufficient evidence for a treatment effect. Specific phobia of dental treatment 
      and dental anxiety are prevalent conditions that can cause an oral health 
      impairment. This paper critically reviews 19 clinical trials aimed at reducing 
      dental anxiety and fear avoidance in adults, published in peer-reviewed journals 
      between 1979 and 2021. The search identified 257 papers; 223 were selected after 
      removing duplicates. A total of 188 articles were excluded after title and 
      abstract evaluation; 35 full text articles were assessed for eligibility. Another 
      10 papers were discharged after full text evaluation, as these were case reports 
      and questionnaires. Six papers were discharged due to the lack of a comparable 
      scale to measure dental anxiety. The following treatment techniques were 
      reviewed: various forms of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), relaxation 
      training, benzodiazepine premedication, self-hypnosis by audio therapy, 
      hypnotherapy, hypnosis, and nitrous oxide sedation. CBT delivered in a variety of 
      formats, including one-session treatment, showed the most evidence for the 
      efficacy of reducing anxiety. A wide heterogeneity of methods allowed only the 
      inclusion of five studies to the performed meta-analysis, showing contrasting 
      results for the application of hypnosis. The main reason for this issue is the 
      great variety in methods used, making a distinct assessment of hypnotic 
      interventions difficult. However, the results of the systematic review are 
      promising in that hypnosis can also be regarded as powerful and successful method 
      for anxiety reduction, while there are also studies with a small or even slightly 
      negative effect. Therefore, further research is needed. Within the limitations of 
      the current study, a more consistent use of methods to examine anxiety for 
      hypnosis research is recommended.

TI  - Treatment of Persistent Postural-Perceptual Dizziness (PPPD) and Related 
      Disorders.
PG  - 50
LID - 10.1007/s11940-018-0535-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a newly 
      defined disorder of functional dizziness that in the International Classification 
      of Diseases in its 11th revision (ICD-11) supersedes phobic postural vertigo and 
      chronic subjective dizziness. Despite efforts to unify the diagnosis of 
      functional (somatoform) dizziness, patients will present with a variety of 
      triggers, perpetuating factors, and comorbidities, requiring individualized 
      treatment. This article will review different treatment strategies for this 
      common functional neurological disorder and provide practical recommendations for 
      tailored therapy. RECENT FINDINGS: An emerging understanding of the underlying 
      pathophysiology that considers vestibular, postural, cognitive, and emotional 
      aspects can enable patients to profit from vestibular rehabilitation, as well as 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Crucially, approaches from CBT should inform 
      and augment physiotherapeutic techniques, and, on the other hand, vestibular 
      exercises or relaxation techniques can be integrated into CBT programs. 
      Antidepressant medication might further facilitate rehabilitation, though the 
      mechanisms are yet to be elucidated, and the level of evidence is low. In PPPD 
      and related disorders, vestibular rehabilitation combined with CBT, and possibly 
      supported by medication, can help patients escape a cycle of maladaptive balance 
      control, recalibrate vestibular systems, and regain independence in everyday 
      life.

TI  - Exercise for anxiety disorders: systematic review.
PG  - 187-96
LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091287 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are commonly treated with antidepressants and 
      psychological treatments. Some patients may prefer alternative approaches such as 
      exercise. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the treatment effects of exercise compared 
      with other treatments for anxiety disorders. DATA SOURCES: Randomised controlled 
      trials (RCTs) of exercise interventions for anxiety disorders were identified by 
      searching six online databases (July 2011). A number of journals were also hand 
      searched. MAIN RESULTS: Eight RCTs were included. For panic disorder: exercise 
      appears to reduce anxiety symptoms but it is less effective than antidepressant 
      medication (1 RCT); exercise combined with antidepressant medication improves the 
      Clinical Global Impression outcomes (1 RCT, p<0.05); exercise combined with 
      occupational therapy and lifestyle changes reduces Beck Anxiety Inventory 
      outcomes (1 RCT, p=0.0002). For social phobias, added benefits of exercise when 
      combined with group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) were shown (p<0.05). 
      There was no significant difference between aerobic and anaerobic exercise groups 
      (1 RCT, p>0.1) with both seeming to reduce anxiety symptoms (1 RCT, p<0.001). It 
      remains unclear as to which type of exercise; moderate to hard or very light to 
      light, is more effective in anxiety reduction (2 RCTs). CONCLUSIONS: Exercise 
      seems to be effective as an adjunctive treatment for anxiety disorders but it is 
      less effective compared with antidepressant treatment. Both aerobic and 
      non-aerobic exercise seems to reduce anxiety symptoms. Social phobics may benefit 
      from exercise when combined with group CBT. Further well-conducted RCTs are 
      needed.

AB  - Anxiety disorders belong to the most frequent psychiatric disorders according to 
      epidemiological studies and are associated with a high economic burden. Panic 
      disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific 
      phobia belong to the most important clinical disorders. The etiology is complex, 
      including genetic, neurobiological as well as psychosocial factors. With regard 
      to treatment, both psychotherapy and medication can be employed according to 
      current treatment guidelines. With regard to psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral 
      therapy (CBT) represents the treatment of choice. As for pharmacological 
      treatment, in particular modern antidepressants and pregabalin are recommended. 
      However, several recommendations have to be considered in daily clinical 
      practice.

TI  - Mindfulness-based therapy versus cognitive behavioral therapy for people with 
      anxiety symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis of random controlled 
      trials.
PG  - 7596-7612
LID - 10.21037/apm-21-1212 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) and cognitive behavioral 
      therapy (CBT) have both been shown to be effective treatment approaches for 
      anxiety. The purpose of this paper was to directly investigate the ability of 
      MBIs and CBT to improve anxiety symptoms (primary outcome), as well as depression 
      symptoms and sleep quality (second outcome). METHODS: We searched the following 
      electronic databases from 1st December, 2019 to 14th January 2021: English 
      databases including PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, 
      Elsevier, Springer Link, Wiley Online Library, ClinicalTrails, and Embase, and 
      Chinese database including CNKI, WANFANG, and CQVIP. The eligibility criteria 
      included the following: (I) patients with anxiety disorders or symptoms of 
      anxiety; and those with physical or mental disorders with comorbid anxiety 
      symptoms; (II) randomized controlled trial (RCT) design; (III) the treatment 
      group received MBIs; (IV) the control group received CBT; and (V) the treatment 
      outcomes were anxiety, depression, and sleep quality. RESULTS: In total, 4,095 
      abstracts were reviewed. Of these, the full-texts of 45 articles were read in 
      detail; and 11 RCTs were finally included in the analysis. Upon completion of 
      MBIs and CBT group sessions, the study outcomes (mean anxiety, depression, and 
      sleep quality scores) revealed no difference between MBIs and CBT with regards to 
      anxiety, depression, and sleep quality post-intervention. Subgroup analysis was 
      also performed, and the results indicated that MBIs may provide a small advantage 
      for people with anxiety symptoms compared to CBT [standard mean difference (SMD): 
      -0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.66 to -0.06], while the CBT group 
      demonstrated a small comparative advantage for anxiety in the Liebowitz Social 
      Anxiety Scale (LSAS) and Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) scales, as well as 
      mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in the types of MBIs (LSAS: SMD: 0.35, 
      95% CI: 0.08 to 0.63; SPIN: SMD: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.92; MBSR: SMD: 0.41, 95% 
      CI: 0.07 to 0.74). DISCUSSION: There was no significant difference between MBIs 
      and CBT in terms of the treatment outcomes of anxiety, depression, and sleep 
      quality. MBIs could be used as an alternative intervention to CBT for anxiety 
      symptoms. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This meta-analysis was conducted in line with the 
      PRISMA guideline and was registered at PROSPERO 
      https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/ (CRD42021219822).

LID - CD004690
AB  - BACKGROUND: A previous Cochrane review (James 2005) showed that cognitive 
      behavioural therapy (CBT) was effective in treating childhood anxiety disorders; 
      however, questions remain regarding (1) the relative efficacy of CBT versus 
      non-CBT active treatments; (2) the relative efficacy of CBT versus medication and 
      the combination of CBT and medication versus placebo; and (3) the long-term 
      effects of CBT.  OBJECTIVES: To examine (1) whether CBT is an effective treatment 
      for childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders in comparison with (a) wait-list 
      controls; (b) active non-CBT treatments (i.e. psychological placebo, 
      bibliotherapy and treatment as usual (TAU)); and (c) medication and the 
      combination of medication and CBT versus placebo; and (2) the long-term effects 
      of CBT. SEARCH METHODS: Searches for this review included the Cochrane Central 
      Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and 
      Neurosis Group Register, which consists of relevant randomised controlled trials 
      from the bibliographic databases－The Cochrane Library (1970 to July 2012), 
      EMBASE, (1970 to July 2012) MEDLINE (1970 to July 2012) and PsycINFO (1970 to 
      July 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CBT 
      versus waiting list, active control conditions, TAU or medication were reviewed. 
      All participants must have met the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical 
      Manual (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) for an anxiety 
      diagnosis, excluding simple phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic 
      stress disorder and elective mutism. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The 
      methodological quality of included trials was assessed by three reviewers 
      independently. For the dichotomous outcome of remission of anxiety diagnosis, the 
      odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the random-effects 
      model, with pooling of data via the inverse variance method of weighting, was 
      used. Significance was set at P < 0.05. Continuous data on each child's anxiety 
      symptoms were pooled using the standardised mean difference (SMD). MAIN RESULTS: 
      Forty-one studies consisting of 1806 participants were included in the analyses. 
      The studies involved children and adolescents with anxiety of mild to moderate 
      severity in university and community clinics and school settings. For the primary 
      outcome of remission of any anxiety diagnosis for CBT versus waiting list 
      controls, intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses with 26 studies and 1350 participants 
      showed an OR of 7.85 (95% CI 5.31 to 11.60, Z = 10.26, P < 0.0001), but with 
      evidence of moderate heterogeneity (P = 0.04, I² = 33%). The number needed to 
      treat (NNT) was 6.0 (95% CI 7.5 to 4.6). No difference in outcome was noted 
      between individual, group and family/parental formats. ITT analyses revealed that 
      CBT was no more effective than non-CBT active control treatments (six studies, 
      426 participants) or TAU in reducing anxiety diagnoses (two studies, 88 
      participants). The few controlled follow-up studies (n = 4) indicate that 
      treatment gains in the remission of anxiety diagnosis are not statistically 
      significant. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive behavioural therapy is an effective 
      treatment for childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders; however, the evidence 
      suggesting that CBT is more effective than active controls or TAU or medication 
      at follow-up, is limited and inconclusive.

LID - 10.1007/s10803-018-3861-x [doi]
AB  - We examined the feasibility and acceptability of using an immersive virtual 
      reality environment (VRE) alongside cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for young 
      people with autism experiencing specific phobia. Thirty-two participants were 
      randomised to treatment or control. Treatment involved one session introducing 
      CBT techniques and four VRE sessions, delivered by local clinical therapists. 
      Change in target behaviour was independently rated. Two weeks after treatment, 
      four treatment participants (25%) and no control participants were responders; at 
      6 months after treatment, six (38%) treatment and no control participants were 
      responders. At 6 months post-treatment, symptoms had worsened for one treatment 
      and five control (untreated) participants. Brief VRE exposure with CBT is 
      feasible and acceptable to deliver through child clinical services and is 
      effective for some participants.

BTI - Anxiety in Children
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of treatments 
      for childhood anxiety disorders, including panic disorder, social anxiety 
      disorder, specific phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, and separation anxiety. 
      DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE(®), Embase(®), PsycINFO(®), Cochrane Central 
      Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and 
      SciVerse Scopus through February 1, 2017, and reviewed bibliographies and the 
      gray literature. REVIEW METHODS: We included randomized and non-randomized 
      comparative studies that compared psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or a 
      combination in children ages 3 to 18 years with panic disorder, social anxiety 
      disorder, specific phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, or separation anxiety. 
      Pairs of independent reviewers selected studies using pre-specified inclusion and 
      exclusion criteria. RESULTS: We included 206 studies. Compared with pill placebo, 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake 
      inhibitors improved primary anxiety symptoms (moderate to high strength of 
      evidence [SOE]). Tricyclic antidepressants marginally improved clinical response 
      (low SOE). Benzodiazepines did not show significant improvement in primary 
      anxiety symptoms (low SOE). Data on head-to-head comparisons across drugs were 
      sparse (only 2 RCTs; low SOE). Compared with waitlisting or no treatment, 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) improved primary anxiety symptoms (clinician, 
      child, and parent report), function, remission, and clinical response (low to 
      moderate SOE). Compared with other therapies (attention control or treatment as 
      usual), CBT reduced primary anxiety symptoms (child report; moderate SOE). 
      Compared with CBT alone, the combination of imipramine and CBT reduced primary 
      anxiety symptoms (child report) and function (moderate SOE). The combination of 
      sertraline and CBT reduced primary anxiety symptoms (clinician report), improved 
      function, and increased clinical response compared with CBT alone or sertraline 
      alone (moderate SOE). CBT reduced primary anxiety symptoms and improved function 
      more than fluoxetine, and was more likely to increase remission than sertraline. 
      Medications increased short-term adverse events that were mostly not serious (low 
      or moderate SOE). Studies were too small or too short to assess suicidality with 
      SSRI or SNRI. One trial showed a statistically nonsignificant increase in 
      suicidal ideation with venlafaxine (low SOE). CONCLUSIONS: CBT is effective in 
      reducing anxiety symptoms and improving function. Medications, primarily those 
      targeting serotonin, are also effective and were associated with various 
      short-term adverse events, which were mostly not serious, but studies were too 
      small or too short to assess suicidality with SSRI or SNRI. The combination of 
      medications and CBT is likely more effective than either treatment alone. 
      Comparative effectiveness evidence between various medications and comparing CBT 
      versus medications, or the combination, is limited and represents a need for 
      research in this field. Future research is needed to evaluate components of CBT, 
      effect modifiers of treatment, and long-term safety of drugs, and needs to be 
      more inclusive of underserved populations and minorities.

TI  - Exercise in the treatment of clinical anxiety in general practice - a systematic 
      review and meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are common, yet treatment options in general 
      practice are often limited to medication or CBT. There is a lack of evidence for 
      the effectiveness of exercise in the treatment of anxiety in patients who present 
      to general practice and also about the intensity of exercise required to lead to 
      improvement. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the use of exercise 
      versus waiting list control groups in the treatment of anxiety and also to assess 
      the benefit of high intensity exercise vs low intensity exercise. Long term 
      follow up scores were also analysed. We included patients who met diagnostic 
      criteria for anxiety disorders or had clinically raised anxiety levels on a 
      validated rating scale and performed a subgroup analysis of the outcomes between 
      the two groups. The intervention was any aerobic exercise programme carried out 
      for at least two weeks, or exercise carried out at high intensity for at least 
      two weeks. The comparison groups were either a waiting list control group or low 
      intensity exercise. METHOD: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials. 
      Three databases were searched; CENTRAL, Medline and Embase. Outcome assessment 
      was based on validated anxiety rating scales. The quality of the studies was 
      appraised according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Effect sizes were 
      calculated using the standardised mean difference. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were 
      identified with a total of 675 patients. Nine trials had participants with 
      diagnosed anxiety disorders and six trials had participants with raised anxiety 
      on a validated rating scale. Aerobic exercise was effective in the treatment of 
      raised anxiety compared to waiting list control groups (effect size - 0.41, 95% 
      CI = - 0.70 to - 0.12). High intensity exercise programmes showed greater effects 
      than low intensity programmes. There was no significant difference in outcomes 
      between groups of patients with diagnosed anxiety disorders and patients who had 
      raised anxiety on a rating scale. Conclusions were limited by the small number of 
      studies and wide variation in the delivery of exercise interventions. CONCLUSION: 
      Exercise programmes are a viable treatment option for the treatment of anxiety. 
      High intensity exercise regimens were found to be more effective than low 
      intensity regimens. The results have implications for the use of exercise schemes 
      in General Practice.

TI  - EMDR therapy for misophonia: a pilot study of case series.
PG  - 1968613
LID - 10.1080/20008198.2021.1968613 [doi]
LID - 1968613
AB  - BACKGROUND: Misophonia is a disorder in which patients suffer from anger or 
      disgust when confronted with specific sounds such as loud chewing or breathing, 
      causing avoidance of cue-related situations resulting in significant functional 
      impairment. Though the first treatment studies with cognitive behavioural therapy 
      (CBT) showed promising results, an average of 50% of the patients has not 
      improved much clinically. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this pilot study was to assess 
      the effectiveness of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy 
      as a trauma-focused approach in treating misophonia symptoms. METHOD: A sample of 
      10 adult participants with misophonia was studied at the outpatient clinic of the 
      Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam. Participants were either on the waiting 
      list for CBT or non-responders to CBT. EMDR was focused on misophonia-related 
      emotionally disturbing memories and delivered in a mean of 2.6 sessions of 
      60-90 minutes. Pre- and post-treatment self-assessed ratings of misophonia 
      symptoms (AMISOS-R, primary outcome), of general psychopathology (SCL-90-R) and 
      of quality of life (SDS) were administered. The co-primary outcome was the 
      Clinical Global Impression Improvement scale (CGI-I). RESULTS: A paired t-test 
      (n = 8) showed improvement on the primary outcome (-6.14 [MD], 5.34 [SD]) on the 
      AMISOS-R (P = .023). Three of the eight patients showed clinically significant 
      improvement measured with the CGI-I. No significant effect on secondary outcomes 
      was found. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that EMDR therapy 
      focused on emotionally disturbing misophonia-related memories can reduce 
      misophonia symptoms. RCTs with sufficient sample sizes are required to firmly 
      establish the value of EMDR therapy for misophonia.

TI  - Therapist-Guided Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy vs 
      Internet-Delivered Supportive Therapy for Children and Adolescents With Social 
      Anxiety Disorder: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 705-713
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.0469 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a prevalent childhood-onset disorder 
      associated with lifelong adversity and high costs for the individual and society 
      at large. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an established evidence-based 
      treatment for SAD, but its availability is limited. OBJECTIVE: To assess the 
      efficacy and cost-effectiveness of therapist-guided internet-delivered cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (ICBT) for SAD in youths vs an active comparator, 
      internet-delivered supportive therapy (ISUPPORT). DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This single-masked, superiority randomized clinical trial enrolled 
      participants at a clinical research unit integrated within the child and 
      adolescent mental health services in Stockholm, Sweden, from September 1, 2017, 
      to October 31, 2018. The final participant reached the 3-month follow-up (primary 
      end point) in May 2019. Children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age with a 
      principal diagnosis of SAD and their parents were included in the study. 
      INTERVENTIONS: ICBT and ISUPPORT, both including 10 online modules, 5 separate 
      parental modules, and 3 video call sessions with a therapist. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: The Clinician Severity Rating (CSR), derived from the Anxiety Disorder 
      Interview Schedule, rated by masked assessors 3 months after the end of 
      treatment. The CSR ranges from 0 to 8, with scores of 4 or higher indicating 
      caseness. Secondary outcomes included masked assessor-rated diagnostic status of 
      SAD and global functioning, child- and parent-reported social anxiety and 
      depressive symptoms, and health-related costs. RESULTS: Of the 307 youths 
      assessed for eligibility, 103 were randomized to 10 weeks of therapist-guided 
      ICBT (n = 51) or therapist-guided ISUPPORT (n = 52) for SAD. The sample consisted 
      of 103 youths (mean [SD] age, 14.1 [2.1] years; 79 [77%] female). 
      Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy was significantly more 
      efficacious than ISUPPORT in reducing the severity of SAD symptoms. Mean (SD) CSR 
      scores for ICBT at baseline and at the 3-month follow-up were 5.06 (0.95) and 
      3.96 (1.46), respectively, compared with 4.94 (0.94) and 4.48 (1.30) for 
      ISUPPORT. There was a significant between-group effect size of d = 0.67 (95% CI, 
      0.21-1.12) at the 3-month follow-up. Similarly, all of the secondary outcome 
      measures demonstrated significant differences with small to large effect sizes, 
      except for child-rated quality of life (nonsignificant). The cost-effectiveness 
      analyses indicated cost savings associated with ICBT compared with ISUPPORT, with 
      the main drivers of the savings being lower medication costs (z = 2.38, P = .02) 
      and increased school productivity (z = 1.99, P = .047) in the ICBT group. There 
      was 1 suicide attempt in the ISUPPORT group; no other serious adverse events 
      occurred in either group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical 
      trial, internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy was an efficacious and 
      cost-effective intervention for children and adolescents with SAD. Implementation 
      in clinical practice could markedly increase the availability of effective 
      interventions for SAD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:

      Version 3. Part I: Anxiety disorders.
PG  - 1-39
LID - 10.1080/15622975.2022.2086295 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This is the third version of the guideline of the World Federation of 
      Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) Task Force for the Pharmacological 
      Treatment of Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive and Posttraumatic Stress Disorders 
      (published in 2002, revised in 2008). METHOD: A consensus panel of 33 
      international experts representing 22 countries developed recommendations based 
      on efficacy and acceptability of available treatments. In total, 1007 RCTs for 
      the treatment of these disorders in adults, adolescents, and children with 
      medications, psychotherapy and other non-pharmacological interventions were 
      evaluated, applying the same rigorous methods that are standard for the 
      assessment of medications. RESULT: This paper, Part I, contains recommendations 
      for the treatment of panic disorder/agoraphobia (PDA), generalised anxiety 
      disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), specific phobias, mixed anxiety 
      disorders in children and adolescents, separation anxiety and selective mutism. 
      Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and serotonin-norepinephrine 
      reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are first-line medications. Cognitive behavioural 
      therapy (CBT) is the first-line psychotherapy for anxiety disorders. The expert 
      panel also made recommendations for patients not responding to standard 
      treatments and recommendations against interventions with insufficient evidence. 
      CONCLUSION: It is the goal of this initiative to provide treatment guidance for 
      these disorders that has validity throughout the world.

AB  - Lars-Göran Öst is one of the most eminent clinical researchers in the field of 
      cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and a founder of CBT in Sweden. He has recently 
      retired from his position as professor in clinical psychology at Stockholm 
      University, Sweden. In this paper, we sketch a brief description of the body of 
      work by Öst. Examples of his innovative and pioneering new treatment methods 
      include the one-session treatment for specific phobias, as well as applied 
      relaxation for a range of anxiety disorders and health conditions. While Öst 
      remains active in the field, he has contributed significantly to the development 
      and dissemination of CBT in Sweden as well as in the world.

TI  - Assessment and treatment of social phobia.
PG  - 826-34
AB  - Social phobia is an anxiety disorder characterized by heightened fear and 
      avoidance of one or more social or performance situations, including public 
      speaking, meeting new people, eating or writing in front of others, and attending 
      social gatherings. People with social phobia are typically anxious about the 
      possibility that others will evaluate them negatively and/or notice symptoms of 
      their anxiety. Social phobia affects up to 13% of individuals at some time in 
      their lives and is usually associated with at least moderate functional 
      impairment. Research on the nature and treatment of social phobia has increased 
      dramatically over the past decade. As with many of the anxiety disorders, 
      sensitive assessment instruments and effective treatments now exist for people 
      suffering from heightened social anxiety. Typical assessment strategies include 
      clinical interviews, behavioural assessments, monitoring diaries, and self-report 
      questionnaires. Treatments with demonstrated efficacy for social phobia include 
      pharmacotherapy (for example, phenelzine, moclobemide, selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitor [SSRI] medications) and cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) (for 
      example, cognitive restructuring, in vivo exposure, social skills training). 
      Although preliminary comparative studies suggest that both approaches are about 
      equally effective in the short term, each approach has advantages and 
      disadvantages over the other. Trials examining combined psychological and 
      pharmacological treatments are now under way, although no published data on the 
      relative efficacy of combined treatments are currently available.

TI  - Augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies (CBT) with d-cycloserine for 
      anxiety and related disorders.
PG  - CD007803
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD007803.pub2 [doi]
LID - CD007803
AB  - BACKGROUND: A significant number of patients who suffer with anxiety and related 
      disorders (that is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social anxiety disorder 
      (SAnD), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (PD), specific phobia (SPh) 
      and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)) fail to respond optimally to first-line 
      treatment with medication or cognitive and behavioural therapies. The addition of 
      d-cycloserine (DCS) to cognitive and behavioural therapies may improve treatment 
      response by impacting the glutamatergic system. This systematic review aimed to 
      investigate the effects of adding DCS to cognitive and behavioural therapies by 
      synthesising data from relevant randomised controlled trials and following the 
      guidelines recommended by Cochrane. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of DCS 
      augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies compared to placebo 
      augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies in the treatment of anxiety 
      and related disorders. Additionally, to assess the efficacy and tolerability of 
      DCS across different anxiety and related disorders. SEARCH METHODS: This review 
      fully incorporates studies identified from a search of the Cochrane Depression, 
      Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR) to 12 March 2015. This 
      register includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from: the Cochrane 
      Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date), PsycINFO 
      (1967 to date), the World Health Organization's trials portal (ICTRP) and 
      ClinicalTrials.gov . Reference lists from previous meta-analyses and reports of 
      RCTs were also checked. No restrictions were placed on language, setting, date or 
      publication status. SELECTION CRITERIA: All RCTs of DCS augmentation of cognitive 
      and behavioural therapies versus placebo augmentation of cognitive and 
      behavioural therapies for anxiety and related disorders were included. DATA 
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors (RO and TA) independently assessed RCTs for 
      eligibility and inclusion, extracted outcomes and risk of bias data and entered 
      these into a customised extraction form. Investigators were contacted to obtain 
      missing data. In addition, data entry and analysis were performed by two review 
      authors (KSW and HB). MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-one published RCTs, with 788 
      participants in outpatient settings, were included in the review. Sixteen studies 
      had an age range of 18 to 75 years, while four investigated paediatric 
      populations aged 8 to 17 years and one included children, adolescents and adults. 
      The 21 RCTs investigated OCD (number of RCTs (N) = 6), PTSD (N = 5), SAnD (N = 
      5), SPh (N = 3) and PD (N = 2). Most information from the studies was rated as 
      having either low risk or unclear risk of bias.There was no evidence of a 
      difference between DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies and 
      placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies for the treatment of 
      anxiety and related disorders in adults at the endpoint (treatment responders, N 
      = 9, risk ratio (RR) 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.34; number of 
      participants (n) = 449; low quality evidence) and between 1 and 12 months 
      follow-up (N = 7, RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.31; n = 383). DCS augmentation of 
      cognitive and behavioural therapies was not superior to placebo augmentation of 
      cognitive and behavioural therapies for children and adolescents, both at the 
      endpoint (N = 4, RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.31; n = 121; low quality evidence) and 
      between 3 and 12 months follow-up (N = 3, RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.09; n = 
      91).There was no evidence of a difference in treatment acceptability for DCS 
      augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies compared with placebo 
      augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies in adults (N = 16, RR 0.88; 
      95% CI 0.61 to 1.25; n = 740), nor in children and adolescents (N = 4, RR 0.90; 
      95% CI 0.17 to 4.69; n = 131). These conclusions were based on moderate quality 
      evidence for adults, and very low quality evidence for children and adolescents. 
      Although the observed difference was small, it is noteworthy that there was a 
      high efficacy of exposure-based therapies alone in the included trials. Due to 
      the limited number of studies, subgroup analysis of moderating factors for 
      clinical and methodological effect could not take place. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: 
      This review found no evidence of a difference between DCS augmentation of 
      cognitive and behavioural therapies and placebo augmentation of cognitive and 
      behavioural therapies for treating anxiety and related disorders in children, 
      adolescents and adults. These findings are based on low quality evidence from 
      heterogenous studies with small sample sizes and incomplete data for clinical 
      response, which precludes us from drawing conclusions on the use of DCS 
      augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies at this stage. Given there is 
      some promising preliminary data from individual studies, further research is 
      necessary to assess DCS compared with placebo augmentation of cognitive and 
      behavioural therapies, and determine mechanisms of action as well as magnitude of 
      effect in anxiety and related disorders.

TI  - Parental anxiety as a predictor of medication and CBT response for anxious youth.
PG  - 84-93
LID - 10.1007/s10578-014-0454-6 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this investigation was to evaluate how parental anxiety predicted 
      change in pediatric anxiety symptoms across four different interventions: 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy, medication (sertraline; SRT), their combination 
      (COMB), and pill placebo. Participants were 488 youths (ages 7-17) with 
      separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and/or social phobia 
      and their primary caregivers. Latent growth curve modeling assessed how 
      pre-treatment parental trait anxiety symptoms predicted trajectories of youth 
      anxiety symptom change across 12 weeks of treatment at four time points. 
      Interactions between parental anxiety and treatment condition were tested. 
      Parental anxiety was not associated with youth's pre-treatment anxiety symptom 
      severity. Controlling for parental trait anxiety, youth depressive symptoms, and 
      youth age, youths who received COMB benefitted most. Counter to expectations, 
      parental anxiety influenced youth anxiety symptom trajectory only within the SRT 
      condition, whereas parental anxiety was not significantly associated with youth 
      anxiety trajectories in the other treatment conditions. Specifically, within the 
      SRT condition, higher levels of parental anxiety predicted a faster and greater 
      reduction in youth anxiety over the acute treatment period compared to youths in 
      the SRT condition whose parents had lower anxiety levels. While all active 
      treatments produced favorable outcomes, results provide insight regarding the 
      treatment-specific influence of parental anxiety on the time course of symptom 
      change.

TI  - Cost and effectiveness of one session treatment (OST) for children and young 
      people with specific phobias compared to multi-session cognitive behavioural 
      therapy (CBT): results from a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 547
LID - 10.1186/s12888-022-04192-8 [doi]
LID - 547
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the UK, around 93,000 (0.8%) children and young people (CYP) are 
      experiencing specific phobias that have a substantial impact on daily life. The 
      current gold-standard treatment-multi-session cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) 
      - is effective at reducing specific phobia severity; however, CBT is time 
      consuming, requires specialist CBT therapists, and is often at great cost and 
      limited availability. A briefer variant of CBT called one session treatment (OST) 
      has been found to offer similar clinical effectiveness for specific phobia as 
      multi-session CBT. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
      OST compared to multi-session CBT for CYP with specific phobias through the 
      Alleviating Specific Phobias Experienced by Children Trial (ASPECT), a two-arm, 
      pragmatic, multi-centre, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial. METHODS: 
      CYP aged seven to 16 years with specific phobias were recruited nationally via 
      Health and Social Care pathways, remotely randomised to the intervention group 
      (OST) or the control group (CBT-based therapies) and analysed (n = 267). Resource 
      use based on NHS and personal social services perspective and quality adjusted 
      life years (QALYs) measured by EQ-5D-Y were collected at baseline and at 
      six-month follow-up. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated, 
      and non-parametric bootstrapping was conducted to capture the uncertainty around 
      the ICER estimates. The results were presented on a cost-effectiveness 
      acceptability curve (CEAC). A set of sensitivity analyses (including taking a 
      societal perspective) were conducted to assess the robustness of the primary 
      findings. RESULTS: After adjustment and bootstrapping, on average CYP in the OST 
      group incurred less costs (incremental cost was -£302.96 (95% CI -£598.86 to 
      -£28.61)) and maintained similar improvement in QALYs (QALYs gained 0.002 (95% 
      CI - 0.004 to 0.008)). The CEAC shows that the probability of OST being 
      cost-effective was over 95% across all the WTP thresholds. Results of a set of 
      sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary outcomes. CONCLUSION: 
      Compared to CBT, OST produced a reduction in costs and maintained similar 
      improvement in QALYs. Results from both primary and sensitivity analyses 
      suggested that OST was highly likely to be cost saving. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - Attention Bias Modification (ABM) is a novel computerized therapy for anxiety 
      disorders and is thought to augment the effect of Cognitive Behavior Therapy 
      (CBT) as it may target different mechanisms. Recently, a growing number of 
      studies have examined the combined effects of ABM and CBT on clinically anxious 
      patients, with mixed results. This review examined the combined efficacy of ABM 
      and CBT. A literature search was conducted in four main databases: PsycINFO, 
      Embase, Pubmed and the Cochrane library, resulting in 11 randomized studies. The 
      combination of ABM and CBT had small but significant effects on clinician-rated 
      anxiety symptoms and attention bias towards threat compared to the control group, 
      while ESs for anxiety (all measures), self-reported or parent-reported anxiety 
      measures and depression symptoms were non-significant. Studies in which ABM was 
      conducted as an integral part of each CBT session yielded greater reduction in 
      anxiety symptoms than those conducting ABM and CBT at separate time points. Older 
      participants and patients with social anxiety disorder tended to benefit less 
      from the combination of ABM and CBT based on bias scores. This study may provide 
      preliminary evidence that ABM and CBT have the potential to complement each 
      other, especially when they are conducted integrally.

AB  - With a lifetime prevalence of 13% social phobia (social anxiety disorder) is a 
      common and serious condition that should not be played down because of the burden 
      associated with the disorder, an increased suicide rate and the frequent 
      comorbidity with substance abuse disorders. Social phobia is characterized by the 
      excessive and unrealistic fear of being scrutinized or criticized by others. The 
      disorder often begins in adolescence.Symptoms of social phobia can be effectively 
      treated with evidence-based treatment, including cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) 
      and psychopharmacological medications. In the present paper, treatment 
      recommendations are given, which are based on a systematic review of all 
      available randomized trials for the treatment of social phobia. Among 
      psychological therapies, variants of CBT have been proven to be effective in 
      controlled studies. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and the 
      selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine are 
      among the drugs of first choice.

TI  - Relative effects of CBT and pharmacotherapy in depression versus anxiety: is 
      medication somewhat better for depression, and CBT somewhat better for anxiety?
PG  - 560-7
LID - 10.1002/da.20829 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about whether cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or 
      pharmacotherapy is relatively more advantageous for depressive versus anxiety 
      disorders. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis wherein we searched electronic 
      databases and references to select randomized controlled studies comparing CBT 
      and pharmacotherapy, with or without placebo, in adults with major depressive or 
      anxiety disorders. The primary effect size was calculated from disorder-specific 
      outcome measures as the difference between CBT and pharmacotherapy outcomes 
      (i.e., positive effect size favors CBT; negative effect size favors 
      pharmacotherapy). RESULTS: Twenty-one anxiety (N = 1,266) and twenty-one 
      depression (N = 2,027) studies comparing medication to CBT were included. 
      Including all anxiety disorders, the overall effect size was.25 (95% CI: -0.02, 
      0.55, P =.07). Effects for panic disorder significantly favored CBT over 
      medications (.50, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.98). Obsessive-compulsive disorder showed 
      similar effects-sizes, though not statistically significant (.49, 95% CI: -0.11, 
      1.09). Medications showed a nonsignificant advantage for social anxiety disorder 
      (-.22, 95% CI: -0.50, 0.06). The overall effect size for depression studies 
      was.05 (95% CI: -0.09, 0.19), with no advantage for medications or CBT. Pooling 
      anxiety disorder and depression studies, the omnibus comparison of the relative 
      difference between anxiety and depression in effectiveness for CBT versus 
      pharmacotherapy pointed to a nonsignificant advantage for CBT in anxiety versus 
      depression (B =.14, 95% CI: -0.14, 0.43). CONCLUSIONS: On balance, the evidence 
      presented here indicates that there are at most very modest differences in 
      effects of CBT versus pharmacotherapy in the treatment of anxiety versus 
      depressive disorders. There seems to be larger differences between the anxiety 
      disorders in terms of their relative responsiveness to pharmacotherapy versus 
      CBT.

AB  - Among children and adolescents, anxiety disorders are common psychiatric 
      disorders that confer risk of comorbid psychiatric disorders and social and 
      academic impairment. This review focuses on the assessment and treatment of 
      anxiety disorders among children and adolescents, with attention to separation 
      anxiety disorder, social phobia disorder (social anxiety disorder), panic 
      disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Comprehensive assessment of child and 
      adolescent anxiety disorders benefits from a multimethod approach to evaluation 
      and diagnosis, including semistructured interviews; child and informant 
      questionnaires; collateral information from parents, teachers, pediatricians, and 
      school psychologists; and behavioral observations. Because anxiety symptoms can 
      include avoidance behaviors, somatic complaints, social difficulties, and sleep 
      disturbances, consideration of a differential diagnosis is important. Among the 
      available psychosocial interventions, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and 
      exposure-based therapies have emerged as the most well-established treatment 
      approaches for addressing anxiety disorders among children and adolescents. 
      Pharmacologically, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been 
      established to be safe and efficacious for the treatment of pediatric anxiety and 
      are considered the medications of choice for this population. Research indicates 
      that CBT plus SSRI medication is the most effective treatment of anxiety for 
      youths ages seven to 17, compared with either CBT or medication alone. Medication 
      monotherapy and CBT monotherapy have also been demonstrated to be effective 
      treatments.

AB  - This article reviews the current screening and assessment tools for anxiety 
      disorders in children and adolescents, as well as evidence-based treatment 
      interventions for these disorders. The following anxiety disorders are discussed: 
      separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, panic 
      disorder, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), and selective mutism. There 
      are several well-studied screening and assessment tools to identify childhood 
      anxiety disorders early and differentiate the various anxiety disorders. 
      Evaluations of baseline somatic symptoms, severity, and impairment ratings of the 
      anxiety disorders, and collecting ratings from several sources is clinically 
      helpful in assessment and treatment follow-up. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) 
      has been extensively studied and has shown good efficacy in treatment of 
      childhood anxiety disorders. A combination of CBT and medication may be required 
      for moderate to severely impairing anxiety disorders and may improve functioning 
      better than either intervention alone. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
      are currently the only medications that have consistently shown efficacy in 
      treatment of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. Despite proven 
      efficacy, the availability of CBT in the community is limited. Current research 
      is focusing on early identification of anxiety disorders in community settings, 
      increasing the availability of evidence-based interventions, and modification of 
      interventions for specific populations.

      present treatment and potential new treatment advances for pediatric anxiety 
      disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, 
      social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. 
      Disorder-specific treatment methods and innovations, particularly 
      computer-assisted methods of delivery for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) will 
      be reviewed. Additionally, the paper will discuss novel psychopharmacological 
      compounds (e.g., D-cycloserine, riluzole, memantine, and anticonvulsant 
      medications). Available evidence for the efficacy of novel medication strategies 
      in adult studies and implications for their use in pediatrics will be discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, internet-delivered psychotherapeutic 
      interventions (IPI) move increasingly into the focus of attention. METHOD: We 
      reviewed 39 randomized controlled studies of IPIs with 97 study arms (n = 4122 
      patients) for anxiety disorders (panic disorder/agoraphobia, generalized anxiety 
      disorder, and social anxiety disorder) and performed a meta-analysis. Most 
      studies were conducted with cognitive behavioural approaches (iCBT). Results were 
      compared with a previous meta-analysis examining medications and face-to-face 
      (F2F) psychotherapy. RESULTS: In direct comparisons, IPIs were as effective as 
      F2F-CBT and superior to waitlist controls. Programs with more intensive therapist 
      contact yielded higher effect sizes (ES). We compared the obtained ES with a 
      previous comprehensive meta-analysis of 234 studies. In this comparison, iCBT was 
      less effective than individual F2F-CBT and medications, not different from pill 
      placebos, and more effective than psychological placebo and waitlist (p > .0001 
      for all comparisons). ES of IPIs may be overestimated. Treatments were only 
      compared to waitlist, which is not a sufficient control condition. 97% of the 
      studies were not blinded with regard to the main outcome measure. 32% of the 
      participants received antianxiety drugs during the trials. In 89%, participants 
      were recruited by advertisements rather than from clinical settings, and 63% of 
      the participants had an academic background (students or university employees) 
      which might affect the generalizability of the findings. Remote diagnoses were 
      often made by students without completed training in psychotherapy. In only 15% 
      of the studies, diagnoses were made in personal contact with a psychiatrist or 
      psychologist. In 44% of the studies, the 'therapists' maintaining remote contact 
      with the participants were mostly students without completed psychotherapy 
      education. CONCLUSIONS: IPIs may be a useful tool when face-to-face psychotherapy 
      is not easily available, or as an add-on to standard psychotherapeutic or 
      psychopharmacological treatments but should perhaps not be used as monotherapy. 
      We have suggested standards for future research and the practical use of IPIs.

AB  - The efficacy of psychodynamic therapy (PDT) on social anxiety disorder (SAD) is 
      controversial among different randomized controlled trials (RCTs), so we decide 
      to conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis to study the efficacy of PDT on SAD. 
      Relevant literatures were searched in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane 
      Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, Clinical Trails, and Ovid 
      Medline. Twelve RCTs including 1,213 patients were identified. The primary 
      analysis showed that the efficacy of PDT was weaker than the active group 
      (SMD = 0.15 [0.02, 0.28]) and stronger than the inactive group (SMD = -0.77 
      [-0.95, -0.58]). It suggested that there was significant difference between 
      individual PDT and group PDT (Chi² = 2.84, P = 0.09), and no difference between 
      PDT and CBT on SAD and in the dropout rate. Secondary analysis suggested that 
      depression may be alleviated concurrently (SMD = -0.20 [-0.40, 0.00]). 
      Meta-regression analysis revealed no linear associations between dropout rate and 
      effect size (t = 0.79, P = 0.449), neither does the dose-response relationship 
      between session and effect size (t = -0.01, P = 0.992). These findings 
      demonstrated that PDT could produce significant SAD symptoms reduction and 
      supported its application in treating SAD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurocircuitry models of anxiety disorders suggest dysregulated 
      mechanisms encompassing both automatic and elaborate threat processing. However, 
      the extent to which these processes might be differentially modified by 
      psychotherapy and the neural basis of such changes are unknown. We examined the 
      effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in patients with anxiety disorder 
      on brain responses to subliminal and supraliminal threat. METHODS: 3-Tesla 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess neural responses to 
      disorder-related stimuli, presented during two backward-masking conditions 
      employed to manipulate stimulus awareness. In 28 spider-phobic patients randomly 
      assigned to a therapy group or a waiting-list control group scanning was 
      performed before and after completing CBT or a waiting period. Scanning was 
      performed one time in 16 healthy control subjects. Self-report and behavioral 
      measures were used to relate CBT-mediated brain activation changes with symptom 
      improvement. RESULTS: Untreated patients demonstrated abnormal hyperactivation in 
      the amygdala, fusiform gyrus, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and dorsomedial 
      prefrontal cortex. Successful CBT was reflected in an overall downregulation in 
      these fear circuitry structures, especially in the right amygdala and anterior 
      cingulate cortex, with reductions in amygdala responsiveness associated with 
      self-reported symptom improvement. However, subliminal threat induced a pattern 
      of right-lateralized hyperactivation in the amygdala and fusiform gyrus that was 
      subject to intersession habituation across groups without showing significant 
      sensitivity to CBT. CONCLUSIONS: These results challenge prevailing models that 
      emphasize a role for amygdala automaticity in the maintenance of anxiety. Our 
      results suggest CBT-related changes in neural activation associated with fear 
      responses to consciously perceived threat.

TI  - Psychological treatments for social phobia.
PG  - 308-16
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the empirical status of psychological treatments for social 
      phobia (SP), commenting both on cognitive-behavioural interventions and on more 
      recent iterations of those approaches. We also review the effective components of 
      cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). METHOD: We qualitatively reviewed the 
      empirical literature on the psychological treatment of SP. We include empirical 
      studies, metaanalyses, and recent conference presentations in this review. 
      RESULTS: Cognitive and behavioural interventions for SP appear to be more 
      effective than wait-list controls and supportive therapy. Comparisons of CBT and 
      pharmacologic treatment have produced inconsistent results. Several new 
      treatments for SP demonstrate promising results. CONCLUSION: Evidence suggests 
      that various psychosocial treatments for SP are better than wait-list controls 
      and credible placebo interventions. Ongoing projects investigate the relative 
      efficacy of combining medication and psychosocial treatments over monotherapies; 
      this line of research is important to continue. Further research should also 
      focus on which components of CBT are most effective.

TI  - Clinical and cost-effectiveness of one-session treatment (OST) versus 
      multisession cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for specific phobias in 
      children: protocol for a non-inferiority randomised controlled trial.
PG  - e025031
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025031 [doi]
LID - e025031
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Specific phobias (intense, enduring fears of an object or situation 
      that lead to avoidance and severe distress) are highly prevalent among children 
      and young people. Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is a well-established, 
      effective intervention, but it can be time consuming and costly because it is 
      routinely delivered over multiple sessions during several months. Alternative 
      methods of treating severe and debilitating phobias in children are needed, like 
      one-session treatment (OST), to reduce time and cost, and to prevent therapeutic 
      drift and help children recover quickly. Our study explores whether (1) outcomes 
      with OST are 'no worse' than outcomes with multisession CBT, (2) OST is 
      acceptable to children, their parents and the practitioners who use it and (3) 
      OST offers good value for money to the National Health Service (NHS) and to 
      society. METHOD: A pragmatic, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial will 
      compare OST with multisession CBT-based therapy on their clinical and 
      cost-effectiveness. The primary clinical outcome is a standardised behavioural 
      task of approaching the feared stimulus at 6 months postrandomisation. The 
      outcomes for the within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis are quality-adjusted 
      life years based on EQ-5D-Y, and individual-level costs based of the intervention 
      and use of health and social service care. A nested qualitative evaluation will 
      explore children's, parents' and practitioners' perceptions and experiences of 
      OST. A total of 286 children, 7-16 years old, with DSM-IV diagnoses of specific 
      phobia will be recruited via gatekeepers in the NHS, schools and voluntary youth 
      services, and via public adverts. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial received 
      ethical approval from North East and York Research Ethics Committee (Reference: 
      17/NE/0012). Dissemination plans include publications in peer-reviewed journals, 
      presentations in relevant research conferences, local research symposia and 
      seminars for children and their families, and for professionals and service 
      managers. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN19883421;Pre-results.

TI  - Assessment and management of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents.
PG  - 674-8
AB  - Anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence are extremely common and are often 
      associated with lifelong psychiatric disturbance. Consistent with DSM-5 and the 
      extant literature, this review concerns the assessment and treatment of specific 
      phobias, separation anxiety disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, social 
      anxiety disorder, panic disorder and agoraphobia. Evidence-based psychological 
      treatments (cognitive behaviour therapy; CBT) for these disorders have been 
      developed and investigated, and in recent years promising low-intensity versions 
      of CBT interventions have been proposed that offer a means to increase access to 
      evidence-based treatments. There is some evidence of effectiveness of 
      pharmacological treatments for anxiety disorders in children and young people, 
      however, routine prescription is not recommended due to concerns about potential 
      harm.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This paper seeks to identify the risk factors of fear of 
      childbirth (FOC) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to birth and 
      reviews the efficacy of their respective screening tools and therapeutic 
      interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: Biofeedback, hypnosis, internet-based cognitive 
      behavioral therapy, and antenatal education are promising treatments for FOC. 
      Training midwives to address traumatic birth experiences could help in preventing 
      PTSD. A shorter more pragmatic screening tool for FOC than the Wijma Delivery 
      Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (WDEQ) is needed. Women with PTSD attributed 
      a mismatch between the expected mode of delivery (MOD) and the actual MOD as the 
      cause of their trauma. A history of mental health disorders, lack of social 
      support, previous negative birth experiences, and MOD are correlated to FOC and 
      postpartum PTSD. Psycho-education and CBT-based treatments have been found to 
      reduce levels of FOC and PTSD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This two-year follow-up study evaluated the long-term 
      outcomes of two early interventions that aimed at reducing social and test 
      anxiety in young adolescents at risk for developing social anxiety disorder. 
      METHODS: In this RCT, moderately socially anxious adolescents (N=240, mean age 
      13.6 years) were randomly assigned to a 10-week internet-based multifaceted 
      cognitive bias modification training (CBM), a 10-week school-based cognitive 
      behavioral group training (CBT), or a no-intervention control condition. Using 
      multiple imputation, this study examined the changes in primary and secondary 
      outcome measures from pretest to follow-up in a repeated measures design. 
      RESULTS: Primary outcome: Self-reported social and test anxiety generally 
      decreased from pre-test to two-year follow-up, regardless of treatment condition. 
      The percentage of adolescents who developed a social anxiety disorder was very 
      low (6%) and similar across conditions. Secondary outcome: There were beneficial 
      changes in self-esteem, self-reported prosocial behaviors, and fear of negative 
      evaluation, but none of these were related to treatment condition. Automatic 
      social-threat associations did not significantly change. The CBM intervention was 
      effective in changing interpretative bias as indexed by the Recognition Task but 
      this long-term effect did not transfer to the Adolescent Interpretation and 
      Belief Questionnaire. LIMITATIONS: There was a substantial (50%) though seemingly 
      non-selective attrition at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This RCT does not support the 
      longer-term efficacy of school-based CBT or CBM as an early intervention for 
      social and test anxiety. Rather, it emphasizes the positive 'natural' course of 
      highly socially anxious adolescents over two years.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the last few decades, there has been a growing interest in anxiety 
      disorders (AnxD) in the perinatal period. Although AnxD are diagnosed in 4-39% of 
      pregnant women and in up to 16% of women after delivery, evidence on their 
      clinical management is limited. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted on 
      pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment of AnxD in the perinatal 
      period. Relevant papers published from January 1st 2015 were identified searching 
      the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library. 
      RESULTS: 18 articles met inclusion criteria. Selected studies supported the use 
      of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), 
      panic disorder (PD) and specific phobia both in pregnancy and postpartum. 
      Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) led to significant OCD and PD 
      improvement both in pregnancy and postpartum with no side effects for the babies. 
      In the largest clinical sample to date, 65% of postpartum patients who entered 
      the open-label trial of fluvoxamine (up to 300mg/day) experienced a 30% or 
      greater decrease in the total score of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale 
      (Y-BOCS). During pregnancy, SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) led to 
      remission of panic symptoms and healthy outcomes for the babies. LIMITATIONS: 
      Study design, mostly case reports, and enrolment of subjects mainly from 
      outpatient specialty units might have limited community-wide generalisability. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Keeping in mind the scantiness and heterogeneity of the available 
      literature, the best interpretation of the available evidence appears to be that 
      CBT should be the first treatment offered to pregnant and breastfeeding women 
      with AnxD. However SSRIs can represent a first line treatment strategy, and not 
      exclusively in cases where AnxD is refractory to CBT.

TI  - Comparing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Systemic Therapy for Social Anxiety 
      Disorder: Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial (SOPHO-CBT/ST).
PG  - 1389-1406
LID - 10.1111/famp.12492 [doi]
AB  - This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to pilot the newly developed 
      manualized and monitored systemic therapy (ST) for social anxiety disorder (SAD), 
      as compared to manualized and monitored cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). We 
      conducted a prospective multicenter, assessor-blind pilot RCT on 38 outpatients 
      (ICD F40.1; Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID); Liebowitz Social 
      Anxiety Scale, LSAS-SR >30). The primary outcome was level of social anxiety 
      (LSAS-SR) at the end of treatment. A total of 252 persons were screened, and 38 
      patients were randomized and started therapy (CBT: 20 patients; ST: 18 patients; 
      age: M = 36 years, SD = 14). Within-group, simple-effect intent-to-treat analyses 
      (ITT) showed significant reduction in LSAS-SR (CBT:d = 1.04; ST:d = 1.67), while 
      ITT mixed-design ANOVA demonstrated the advantage of ST (d = 0.81). Per-protocol 
      analyses supported these results. Remission based on reliable change indices also 
      demonstrated significant difference (LSAS-SR: 15% in CBT; 39% in ST;h: 0.550), 
      supported by blind diagnosticians' ratings of those who completed therapy (SCID; 
      45% in CBT, 78% in ST,p = .083). No adverse events were reported. CBT and ST both 
      reduced social anxiety, supporting patient improvement with the newly developed 
      ST for SAD; this has yet to be verified in a subsequent confirmatory RCT.

PG  - 171-83

AB  - Pediatric generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive and 
      uncontrollable worry about a variety of events and is accompanied by physical 
      symptoms such as headaches, tension, restlessness, gastrointestinal distress, and 
      heart palpitations. Symptoms impose marked distress and interfere with social, 
      emotional, and educational functioning. GAD occurs in over 10% of children and 
      adolescents, has an average age of onset of 8.5 years, and is more often reported 
      in girls. Common co-occurring conditions include separation anxiety disorder and 
      social phobia. Assessment involves a multi-informant, multi-method approach 
      involving the child, parents, and school teachers. A clinical interview should be 
      conducted to assess for the three primary ways anxiety presents: behaviors, 
      thoughts, and somatic symptoms. Several semi-structured diagnostic interviews are 
      available, and the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule is increasingly used. 
      Rating scales completed by the patient, caregivers, and teachers provide useful 
      information for diagnosis and symptom monitoring. Several scales are available to 
      assess patients for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
      (4th Edition) GAD diagnosis; however, instruments generally cannot distinguish 
      children with GAD from children with similar anxiety disorders. Both 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
      (SSRIs) have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of pediatric anxiety 
      disorders including GAD. Evidence suggests that the combination of CBT plus 
      sertraline offers additional benefit compared with either treatment alone. With 
      pharmacotherapy, systematic tracking of treatment-emergent adverse events such as 
      headaches, stomach aches, behavioral activation, worsening symptoms, and emerging 
      suicidal thoughts is important. Recommended starting doses are fluvoxamine 25 
      mg/day, fluoxetine 10 mg/day, and sertraline 25 mg/day, though lower starting 
      doses are possible. Dosing can be adjusted as often as weekly with the goal of 
      achieving a high-quality response, while minimizing side effects. Long-term 
      treatment with medication has not been well studied; however, to achieve optimal 
      long-term outcome extended use of medication may be required. It is recommended 
      to continue medication for approximately 1 year following remission in symptoms, 
      and when discontinuing medication to choose a stress-free time of the year. If 
      symptoms return, medication re-initiation should be considered seriously.

TI  - Orexin in the anxiety spectrum: association of a HCRTR1 polymorphism with panic 
      disorder/agoraphobia, CBT treatment response and fear-related intermediate 
      phenotypes.

AB  - Preclinical studies point to a pivotal role of the orexin 1 (OX(1)) receptor in 
      arousal and fear learning and therefore suggest the HCRTR1 gene as a prime 
      candidate in panic disorder (PD) with/without agoraphobia (AG), PD/AG treatment 
      response, and PD/AG-related intermediate phenotypes. Here, a multilevel approach 
      was applied to test the non-synonymous HCRTR1 C/T Ile408Val gene variant 
      (rs2271933) for association with PD/AG in two independent case-control samples 
      (total n = 613 cases, 1839 healthy subjects), as an outcome predictor of a 
      six-weeks exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in PD/AG patients 
      (n = 189), as well as with respect to agoraphobic cognitions (ACQ) (n = 483 
      patients, n = 2382 healthy subjects), fMRI alerting network activation in healthy 
      subjects (n = 94), and a behavioral avoidance task in PD/AG pre- and post-CBT 
      (n = 271). The HCRTR1 rs2271933 T allele was associated with PD/AG in both 
      samples independently, and in their meta-analysis (p = 4.2 × 10(-7)), 
      particularly in the female subsample (p = 9.8 × 10(-9)). T allele carriers 
      displayed a significantly poorer CBT outcome (e.g., Hamilton anxiety rating 
      scale: p = 7.5 × 10(-4)). The T allele count was linked to higher ACQ sores in 
      PD/AG and healthy subjects, decreased inferior frontal gyrus and increased locus 
      coeruleus activation in the alerting network. Finally, the T allele count was 
      associated with increased pre-CBT exposure avoidance and autonomic arousal as 
      well as decreased post-CBT improvement. In sum, the present results provide 
      converging evidence for an involvement of HCRTR1 gene variation in the etiology 
      of PD/AG and PD/AG-related traits as well as treatment response to CBT, 
      supporting future therapeutic approaches targeting the orexin-related arousal 
      system.

AB  - Besides cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychopharmacotherapy belongs to the 
      first-line treatment approaches for anxiety disorders according to all national 
      and international guidelines. According to studies and meta-analyses, modern 
      antidepressants in particular have been proven to be effective. Depending on the 
      substance, there are approvals for panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder 
      and social phobia. There are also approvals for other substance groups, e.g. 
      anticonvulsants for generalized anxiety disorder. Benzodiazepines should be used 
      with caution in view of the risk of dependency. Although effective and 
      well-tolerated medications are available, up to 30% of patients still do not 
      respond or do not respond adequately to treatment. Consequently, research efforts 
      to develop new substances are important. Based on a better understanding of the 
      complex neurobiological mechanisms underlying anxiety disorders, a large number 
      of substances are currently undergoing clinical trials. Modulators of current and 
      new transmitter systems, in particular the glutamatergic and the endocannabinoid 
      systems as well as neuropeptides, are being discussed as innovative substances. 
      Strategies are also being investigated which, in combination with psychotherapy, 
      aim at optimizing fear extinction memory. First studies are also underway on the 
      use of psychedelic agents in combination with psychotherapy for anxiety.

TI  - Transfer of manualized CBT for social phobia into clinical practice (SOPHO-PRAX): 
      a study protocol for a cluster-randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 70
LID - 10.1186/1745-6215-13-70 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is generally known to be 
      efficacious in the treatment of social phobia when applied in RCTs, namely when 
      the treatment manual is based on the Clark-Wells approach. However, little is 
      known about the efficacy of manualized treatments in routine clinical practice 
      (Phase IV of psychotherapy research). The present study (SOPHO-PRAX) is a 
      continuation of a large multicenter randomized clinical trial (SOPHO-NET) and 
      analyzes the extent to which additional training practitioners in manualized 
      procedures enhances treatment effect. METHODS/DESIGN: Thirty-six private 
      practitioners will be included in three treatment centers and randomly designated 
      to either training in manualized CBT or no specific training. The treatment 
      effects of the therapies conducted by both groups of therapists will be compared. 
      A total of 162 patients (n=116 completers; n=58 per condition) will be enrolled. 
      Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) will serve as primary outcome measure. 
      Remission from social phobia is defined as LSAS total ≤ 30 points. Data will be 
      collected at treatment begin, after 8, 15, and 25 sessions (50 min each), at 
      treatment completion, as well at 6 and 12 months post-treatment. DISCUSSION: The 
      present CBT trial combines elements of randomized controlled trials and 
      naturalistic studies in an innovative way. It will directly inform about the 
      incremental effects of procedures established in a controlled trial into clinical 
      practice. Study results are relevant to healthcare decisions and policy. They may 
      serve to improve quality of treatment, and shorten the time frame between the 
      development and widespread dissemination of effective methods, thereby reducing 
      health cost expenditure.The results of this study will not only inform about the 
      degree to which the new methods lead to an improvement of treatment course and 
      outcome, but also about whether the effects of routine psychotherapeutic 
      treatment are comparable to those of the controlled, strictly manualized 
      treatments of the SOPHO-NET study. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov 
      identifier: NCT01388231. This study was funded by the German Federal Ministry of 
      Education and Research (SOPHO-NET: BMBF 01GV0607; SOPHO-PRAX: BMBF 01GV1001).

PG  - 941898

LID - 941898
AB  - Misophonia is characterized by decreased tolerance to specific sounds and 
      associated stimuli that causes significant psychological distress and impairment 
      in daily functioning (Swedo et al., 2022). Aversive stimuli (often called 
      "triggers") are commonly repetitive facial (e.g., nose whistling, sniffling, and 
      throat clearing) or oral (e.g., eating, drinking, and mouth breathing) sounds 
      produced by other humans. Few empirical studies examining the nature and features 
      of misophonia have used clinician-rated structured diagnostic interviews, and 
      none have examined the relationship between misophonia and psychiatric disorders 
      in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5th version (DSM-5; American Psychiatric 
      Association, 2013). In addition, little is known about whether there are any 
      medical health problems associated with misophonia. Accordingly, the purpose of 
      the present study was to improve the phenotypic characterization of misophonia by 
      investigating the psychiatric and medical health correlates of this newly defined 
      disorder. Structured diagnostic interviews were used to assess rates of lifetime 
      and current DSM-5 psychiatric disorders in a community sample of 207 adults. The 
      three most commonly diagnosed current psychiatric disorders were: (1) social 
      anxiety disorder, (2) generalized anxiety disorder, and (3) specific phobia. The 
      three most common lifetime psychiatric disorders were major depressive disorder, 
      social anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. A series of multiple 
      regression analyses indicated that, among psychiatric disorders that were 
      correlated with misophonia, those that remained significant predictors of 
      misophonia severity after controlling for age and sex were borderline personality 
      disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and panic disorder. No medical health 
      problems were significantly positively correlated with misophonia severity.

TI  - Cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents.
PG  - CD004690
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD004690.pub3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A previous Cochrane review (James 2005) showed that cognitive 
      behavioural therapy (CBT) was effective in treating childhood anxiety disorders; 
      however, questions remain regarding (1) the relative efficacy of CBT versus 
      non-CBT active treatments; (2) the relative efficacy of CBT versus medication and 
      the combination of CBT and medication versus placebo; and (3) the long-term 
      effects of CBT.  OBJECTIVES: To examine (1) whether CBT is an effective treatment 
      for childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders in comparison with (a) wait-list 
      controls; (b) active non-CBT treatments (i.e. psychological placebo, 
      bibliotherapy and treatment as usual (TAU)); and (c) medication and the 
      combination of medication and CBT versus placebo; and (2) the long-term effects 
      of CBT. SEARCH METHODS: Searches for this review included the Cochrane Central 
      Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and 
      Neurosis Group Register, which consists of relevant randomised controlled trials 
      from the bibliographic databases－The Cochrane Library (1970 to July 2012), 
      EMBASE, (1970 to July 2012) MEDLINE (1970 to July 2012) and PsycINFO (1970 to 
      July 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CBT 
      versus waiting list, active control conditions, TAU or medication were reviewed. 
      All participants must have met the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical 
      Manual (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) for an anxiety 
      diagnosis, excluding simple phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic 
      stress disorder and elective mutism. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The 
      methodological quality of included trials was assessed by three reviewers 
      independently. For the dichotomous outcome of remission of anxiety diagnosis, the 
      odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the random-effects 
      model, with pooling of data via the inverse variance method of weighting, was 
      used. Significance was set at P < 0.05. Continuous data on each child's anxiety 
      symptoms were pooled using the standardised mean difference (SMD). MAIN RESULTS: 
      Forty-one studies consisting of 1806 participants were included in the analyses. 
      The studies involved children and adolescents with anxiety of mild to moderate 
      severity in university and community clinics and school settings. For the primary 
      outcome of remission of any anxiety diagnosis for CBT versus waiting list 
      controls, intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses with 26 studies and 1350 participants 
      showed an OR of 0.13 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.19, Z = 10.26, P < 0.0001), but with 
      evidence of moderate heterogeneity (P = 0.04, I² = 33%). The number needed to 
      treat (NNT) was 6.0 (95% CI 7.5 to 4.6). No difference in outcome was noted 
      between individual, group and family/parental formats. ITT analyses revealed that 
      CBT was no more effective than non-CBT active control treatments (six studies, 
      426 participants) or TAU in reducing anxiety diagnoses (two studies, 88 
      participants). The few controlled follow-up studies (n = 4) indicate that 
      treatment gains in the remission of anxiety diagnosis are not statistically 
      significant. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive behavioural therapy is an effective 
      treatment for childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders; however, the evidence 
      suggesting that CBT is more effective than active controls or TAU or medication 
      at follow-up, is limited and inconclusive.

TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of body dysmorphic disorder in adolescents.
PG  - 108-13
AB  - Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is an underrecognized and underdiagnosed problem 
      that is relatively common among adolescents. Although the onset of the disorder 
      occurs in adolescence, BDD research in child and adolescent psychiatry is 
      relatively limited. Body dysmorphic disorder has a high rate of co-morbidity with 
      depression and suicide, which indicates important implications for prompt 
      diagnosis and treatment in adolescents with BDD. Effective treatment options 
      include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy with serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitors (SRIs). This paper provides a brief overview of BDD in 
      adolescents, presents and evaluates the most recent literature on approaches to 
      diagnosis and treatment, and highlights some of the characteristics that 
      distinguish BDD from other disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, 
      social phobia, depression, and eating disorders.

TI  - Cognitive-behavioral treatment of social phobia: new advances.
PG  - 289-96
AB  - Cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for social phobia is an effective treatment 
      for many patients, but some patients do not benefit from the treatments and many 
      remain symptomatic. Therefore, researchers have been examining techniques that 
      may improve treatment outcome. In this paper, recent psychopathology and 
      treatment outcome research, much of which supports the expectation that a 
      second-generation CBT treatment may further improve outcome, are discussed. 
      Finally, the authors present a number of CBT techniques that are tailored for the 
      individual treatment of patients with social phobia. These methods, based on 
      comprehensive CBT developed by Foa et al. and on cognitive therapy for social 
      phobia developed by Clark et al. include developing an idiographic model for the 
      patient, conducting safety behaviors experiments, providing video feedback after 
      cognitive preparation, developing a hierarchy, conducting in vivo exposures and 
      other behavioral experiments, imaginal exposure, social skills training, 
      assertiveness training, and behavioral activation for depression.

      an open pilot study.
PG  - 169-77
LID - 10.1007/s10880-008-9143-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the initial feasibility and potential efficacy of a 
      cognitive-behavioral intervention for youth with anxiety disorders and 
      non-medical somatic symptoms. BACKGROUND: Based on a strong relationship between 
      somatic complaints and anxiety disorders, screening youngsters seeking medical 
      care due to physical symptoms with no organic basis may enhance the recognition 
      of anxiety disorders and facilitate access to appropriate services. METHOD: Seven 
      boys and girls, ages 8 through 15, with medically unexplained gastrointestinal 
      complaints and anxiety disorders received a 12-session cognitive-behavioral 
      intervention targeting anxiety and physical symptoms. Assessments were conducted 
      at baseline and following treatment. RESULTS: All participants were classified as 
      treatment responders. Three of the seven participants no longer met diagnostic 
      criteria for their principal anxiety disorder. Children's physical discomfort 
      decreased from a moderate to minimal level based on self- and parent-reports. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our modified cognitive-behavioral approach has promise for reducing 
      anxiety and somatic symptoms in children seeking medical care.

TI  - Baseline Patient Characteristics Predicting Outcome and Attrition in Cognitive 
      Therapy for Social Phobia: Results from a Large Multicentre Trial.
PG  - 35-46
LID - 10.1002/cpp.1936 [doi]
AB  - We examined the role of baseline patient characteristics as predictors of outcome 
      (end-state functioning, response and remission) and attrition for cognitive 
      therapy (CT) in social anxiety disorder (SAD). Beyond socio-demographic and 
      clinical variables such as symptom severity and comorbidity status, previously 
      neglected patient characteristics (e.g., personality, self-esteem, shame, 
      interpersonal problems and attachment style) were analysed. METHOD: Data came 
      from the CT arm of a multicentre RCT with n = 244 patients having DSM-IV SAD. CT 
      was conducted according to the manual by Clark and Wells. Severity of SAD was 
      assessed at baseline and end of treatment with the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale 
      (LSAS). Multiple linear regression analyses and logistic regression analyses were 
      applied. RESULTS: Up to 37% of the post-treatment variance (LSAS) could be 
      explained by all pre-treatment variables combined. Symptom severity (baseline 
      LSAS) was consistently negatively associated with end-state functioning and 
      remission, but not with response. Number of comorbid diagnoses was negatively 
      associated with end-state functioning and response, but not with remission. 
      Self-esteem was positively associated with higher end-state functioning and more 
      shame with better response. Attrition could not be significantly predicted. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the initial probability for treatment 
      success mainly depends on severity of disorder and comorbid conditions while 
      other psychological variables are of minor importance, at least on a nomothetic 
      level. This stands in contrast with efforts to arrive at an empirical-based 
      foundation for differential indication and argues to search for more potent 
      moderators of therapeutic change rather on the process level. KEY PRACTITIONER 
      MESSAGE: Personality, self-esteem, shame, attachment style and interpersonal 
      problems do not or only marginally moderate the effects of interventions in CT of 
      social phobia. Symptom severity and comorbid diagnoses might affect treatment 
      outcome negatively. Beyond these two factors, most patients share a similar 
      likelihood of treatment success when treated according to the manual by Clark and 
      Wells. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

      combination of moclobemide and group cognitive-behavioral therapy) in patients 
      with a generalized form of social phobia. Eighty one patients (38 males and 43 
      females) were randomly assigned to three different therapeutic programs. Patients 
      were regularly assessed on a monthly basis by an independent rater on the LSAS 
      (Liebowitz Social Anxiety scale), CGI (Clinical Global Impression) for severity 
      and change and BAI (Beck Anxiety Inventory). Altogether, sixty-six patients 
      completed the six month treatment period and 15 patients dropped out. All 
      therapeutic groups showed significant improvement. A combination of CBT and 
      pharmacotherapy yielded the most rapid effect. Moclobemide was superior for the 
      reduction of the subjective general anxiety (BAI) during the first 3 months of 
      treatment, but its influence on avoidant behavior (LSAS avoidance subscale) was 
      less pronounced. Conversely, CBT was the best choice for reduction of avoidant 
      behavior while a reduction of subjective general anxiety appeared later than in 
      moclobemide. After 6 months of treatment there were best results reached in 
      groups treated with CBT and there was no advantage of the combined treatment. The 
      relapse rate during the 24-month follow up was significantly lower in the group 
      treated with CBT in comparison with the group A. formerly treated with 
      moclobemide alone.

TI  - Pharmacologic Treatment of Pediatric Anxiety Disorders.
PG  - 151-160
AB  - The last decade has seen considerable advances in the treatment of anxiety 
      disorders in children and adolescents and a considerable expansion of the 
      evidence base for psychopharmacologic in this population. The extant data suggest 
      that, for fear-based anxiety disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, 
      social phobia/social anxiety disorder, and separation anxiety disorder), 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and selective serotonin 
      norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRIs) are well tolerated and offer 
      considerable benefit. However, the salutary effects of SSRIs and SSNRIs in 
      pediatric anxiety disorders are consistently amplified by the addition of 
      psychotherapy, particularly in individuals with social anxiety disorder. 
      Additionally, several key demographic and clinical factors, including male sex, 
      non-minority status, and better family functioning and younger age predict 
      greater symptomatic improvement in youth with fear-based anxiety disorders. Thus, 
      current data suggest that in addition to several forms of psychotherapy, 
      including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), SSRIs and SSNRIs are efficacious in 
      the treatment of these conditions in youth and that CBT + an SSRI may be 
      associated with greater improvement than would be expected with either treatment 
      as monotherapy. Finally, given that some children and adolescents may exhibit 
      partial response to current pharmacotherapies, benzodiazepines, anti-histamines 
      and other agents may have adjunctive roles, despite a lack of data in terms of 
      large, randomized controlled trials.

TI  - Mental imagery as an emotional amplifier: application to bipolar disorder.
PG  - 1251-8
LID - 10.1016/j.brat.2008.09.005 [doi]
AB  - Cognitions in the form of mental images have a more powerful impact on emotion 
      than their verbal counterparts. This review synthesizes the cognitive science of 
      imagery and emotion with transdiagnostic clinical research, yielding novel 
      predictions for the basis of emotional volatility in bipolar disorder. Anxiety is 
      extremely common in patients with bipolar disorder and is associated with 
      increased dysfunction and suicidality, yet it is poorly understood and rarely 
      treated. Mental imagery is a neglected aspect of bipolar anxiety although in 
      anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder and social phobia 
      focusing on imagery has been crucial for the development of cognitive behavior 
      therapy (CBT). In this review we present a cognitive model of imagery and emotion 
      applied to bipolar disorder. Within this model mental imagery amplifies emotion, 
      drawing on Clark's cyclical panic model [(1986). A cognitive approach to panic. 
      Behaviour Research and Therapy, 24, 461-470]. We (1) emphasise imagery's 
      amplification of anxiety (cycle one); (2) suggest that imagery amplifies the 
      defining (hypo-) mania of bipolar disorder (cycle two), whereby the overly 
      positive misinterpretation of triggers leads to mood elevation (escalated by 
      imagery), increasing associated beliefs, goals, and action likelihood (all 
      strengthened by imagery). Imagery suggests a unifying explanation for key 
      unexplained features of bipolar disorder: ubiquitous anxiety, mood instability 
      and creativity. Introducing imagery has novel implications for bipolar treatment 
      innovation--an area where CBT improvements are much-needed.

BTI - Internet-Based Psychological Treatment for Anxiety and Mood Disorders
AB  - It is not evident whether psychological treatment via the internet is 
      non-inferior to corresponding treatment by a therapist. Internet-based cognitive 
      behavioural therapy (CBT), with the support of a therapist, reduces symptoms in 
      adults with social phobia or mild to moderate major depression, and who have 
      themselves sought this form of treatment. There is some evidence that this also 
      applies to panic disorder and generalised anxiety disorder. Most trials have 
      compared the treatment only with waiting lists and have short follow-up periods. 
      Further trials are needed to assess the effect of treatment in the longer term. 
      Given our present level of knowledge, internet-based CBT with therapist support 
      may be considered as part of a wider range of psychological methods for these 
      conditions and mainly for patients who are motivated to seek this form of 
      treatment. Treatment costs for internet-based CBT in the short term are probably 
      lower than for CBT in a group or individually. However, since the effects of 
      these treatment alternatives have not been adequately compared, it is not 
      possible to ascertain which alternative is cost-effective. It is important to 
      investigate whether this type of treatment can reach people who are in need of 
      care but who are not currently being treated through ordinary health and medical 
      care. In order to further clarify what role internet-based treatment might have 
      in the care of anxiety and mood disorders, it is also important to clarify the 
      extent to which internet-based treatment is requested by patients. More and 
      larger-scale studies are required in order to assess: whether internet-based 
      psychological treatment has an effect that is non-inferior to that of established 
      psychological treatment methods; what risks might be involved in participating in 
      internet-based treatment; what effect internet-based psychological treatment has 
      on anxiety and mood disorders in children and adolescents; the effect of types of 
      internet-based psychological treatment other than CBT with therapist support; 
      whether there are groups of patients for whom treatment via the internet is more 
      or less appropriate.

TI  - Psychotherapies for Panic Disorder: A Tale of Two Sites.
PG  - 927-35
LID - 10.4088/JCP.14m09507 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), panic-focused 
      psychodynamic psychotherapy (PFPP), and applied relaxation training (ART) for 
      primary DSM-IV panic disorder with and without agoraphobia in a 2-site randomized 
      controlled trial. METHOD: 201 patients were stratified for site and DSM-IV 
      agoraphobia and depression and were randomized to CBT, PFPP, or ART (19-24 
      sessions) over 12 weeks in a 2:2:1 ratio at Weill Cornell Medical College (New 
      York, New York) and University of Pennsylvania ("Penn"; Philadelphia, 
      Pennsylvania). Any medication was held constant. RESULTS: Attrition rates were 
      ART, 41%; CBT, 25%; and PFPP, 22%. The most symptomatic patients were more likely 
      to drop out of ART than CBT or PFPP (P = .013). Outcome analyses revealed 
      site-by-treatment interactions in speed of Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) 
      change over time (P = .013). At Cornell, no differences emerged on improvement on 
      the primary outcome, estimated speed of change over time on the PDSS; at Penn, 
      ART (P = .025) and CBT (P = .009) showed greater improvement at treatment 
      termination than PFPP. A site-by-treatment interaction (P = .016) for a 
      priori-defined response (40% PDSS reduction) showed significant differences at 
      Cornell: ART 30%, CBT 65%, PFPP 71% (P = .007), but not at Penn: ART 63%, CBT 
      60%, PFPP 48% (P = .37). Penn patients were more symptomatic, differed 
      demographically from Cornell patients, had a 7.2-fold greater likelihood of 
      taking medication, and had a 28-fold greater likelihood of taking 
      benzodiazepines. However, these differences did not explain site-by-treatment 
      interactions. CONCLUSIONS: All treatments substantially improved panic disorder 
      with or without agoraphobia, but patients, particularly the most severely ill, 
      found ART less acceptable. CBT showed the most consistent performance across 
      sites; however, the results for PFPP showed the promise of psychodynamic 
      psychotherapy for this disorder. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - Recent advances in understanding and treating social anxiety disorder.
PG  - 24-33
AB  - The common occurrence and high level of morbidity and burden associated with 
      social anxiety disorder (SAD) are gaining widespread recognition. Interest in 
      understanding and treating the disorder has also grown in response to large-scale 
      investigations that have demonstrated high levels of efficacy with both 
      pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. Such trials indicate that many 
      patients with generalized SAD (roughly 40% to 60%) respond (eg, Clinical Global 
      Impressions-Improvement rating 1 or 2) after an adequate treatment trial, despite 
      having suffered with disabling symptoms for most of their adult lives. First-line 
      therapy options include the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and the 
      dual-acting serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine. Second-line 
      options consist of anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin, valproic acid) and 
      benzodiazepines (clonazepam). Reversible and irreversible monoamine oxidase 
      inhibitors (moclobemide and phenelzine, respectively), while effective, are not 
      widely used. Nonpharmacologic approaches, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy 
      (CBT), are also effective for SAD. Newer treatment strategies such as 
      levetiracetam, atypical antipsychotics, or D-cycloserine in combination with CBT 
      appear promising but require further investigation. Finding a well-tolerated, 
      safe, and effective treatment for each individual patient is crucial as most will 
      require ongoing treatment in order to maintain benefits, prevent SAD relapse, and 
      to experience optimal outcomes in the long term.

      Anxiety Disorder.

AB  - Traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders has been 
      designed to target reductions in negative affect (NA) associated with 
      defense-related processes. However, a subset of anxiety disorders, including 
      social anxiety disorder (SAD), are also characterized by low positive affect (PA) 
      resulting from separate deficits in appetitive-related processes. In contrast to 
      CBT, "third-wave" approaches, such as acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), 
      align more consistently with motivational processes and, as a result, PA. 
      However, the differential effect of CBT and ACT on PA and NA has yet to be 
      investigated. Using secondary data from a randomized controlled trial, the 
      present study sought to compare CBT's (n = 45) and ACT's (n = 35) effect on PA 
      and NA in SAD. Findings were compared to a wait-list (WL) control condition (n = 
      31), as well as normative data from a general adult sample. Baseline PA and NA 
      were also examined as moderators and predictors of theory-relevant treatment 
      outcomes. NA decreased significantly in both CBT and ACT from pre to 
      posttreatment. Although ACT outperformed WL in reducing NA, this effect was not 
      observed for CBT. PA increased significantly in both CBT and ACT from pre to 
      posttreatment, with neither ACT nor CBT outperforming WL in increasing PA. 
      Neither PA nor NA were found to moderate theoretically relevant treatment 
      outcomes. Findings suggest that ACT and CBT share common treatment mechanisms, 
      making them more similar than distinct. Further efforts should be focused on 
      optimizing CBT's and ACT's influence on threat and reward learning, and 
      elucidating common processes of change.

TI  - Brief Cognitive Behavioral Group Therapy and Verbal-Exposure-Augmented Cognitive 
      Behavioral Therapy for Social Anxiety Disorder in University Students: A 
      Randomized Controlled Feasibility Trial.
PG  - 552-557
LID - 10.1177/02537176211026250 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Considering the need for developing and examining evidenced-based 
      programs using a brief group format for management of social anxiety disorder 
      (SAD) at the community level, we studied the efficacy of two brief versions of 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) programs, brief cognitive-behavioral group 
      therapy (bCBGT), and verbal exposure augmented cognitive behavioral therapy 
      (VE-CBT), on social anxiety among university students. METHODS: A single-center, 
      randomized, parallel-group design was adopted. We delivered six weekly two-hour 
      group sessions, bCBGT and VE-CBT, to 41 university students diagnosed with SAD. 
      An independent rater assessed participants using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety 
      Scale (LSAS) and Clinical Global Impression scale-Severity (CGI-S) at baseline, 
      postintervention, and two-month follow-up. A patient-rated measure, Social Phobia 
      Inventory (SPIN), was assessed at the same time-points. RESULTS: There was a 
      significant improvement in severity of social anxiety from baseline to 
      posttreatment and baseline to two-month follow-up in both groups. However, the 
      treatment effects in bCBGT were statistically superior to VE-CBT at 
      postintervention (SPIN, P = 0.038; LSAS, P = 0.028; CGI-S, P = 0.036) and 
      follow-up (SPIN, P = 0.006; LSAS, P = 0.01; CGI-S, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Brief 
      CBT treatments, both bCBGT and VE-CBT, are efficacious for SAD among university 
      students. They have the potential to address barriers associated with SAD 
      management. However, we recommend a longer follow-up and replications in diverse 
      settings.Clinical trial registration number: CTRI/2019/11/021954.

AB  - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) represents that form of psychotherapy which 
      has most research data to build on in the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders 
      for adults. In this review we will introduce CBT and present the results of 
      pertinent outcome research. Efficacy at the end of treatment is discussed, as 
      well as long term effectiveness and the efficacy of combined treatment with 
      medication and CBT. In addition, we discuss the pros and cons of group CBT 
      compared to CBT in individual format, and comorbidity of mental disorders. 
      According to this review CBT is efficacious for major depressive disorder, 
      generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, 
      obsessive compulsive disorder, social phobia and specific phobia. Efficacy of CBT 
      is equal to or better than efficacy of drugs in the treatment of the above 
      disorders, but there is less access to CBT. Longterm effectiveness of CBT appears 
      to be good, but research on combined treatment is yet in its infancy and 
      conclusions are premature on its place in treatment. Key words: Cognitive 
      behavioral therapy, psychotropic treatment, efficacy, long-term effects, combined 
      treatment, mental disorders, adults.

TI  - Neurobiology of anxiety disorders and implications for treatment.
PG  - 941-9
AB  - The neurobiology of the anxiety disorders, which include panic disorder, 
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and specific phobias, among others, has 
      been clarified by advances in the field of classical or Pavlovian conditioning, 
      and in our understanding of basic mechanisms of memory and learning. Fear 
      conditioning occurs when a neutral conditioned stimulus (such as a tone) is 
      paired with an aversive, or unconditioned stimulus (such as a footshock), and 
      then in the absence of the unconditioned stimulus, causes a conditioned fear 
      response. Preclinical studies have shown that the amygdala plays a key role in 
      fear circuitry, and that abnormalities in amygdala pathways can affect the 
      acquisition and expression of fear conditioning. Drugs such as glutamate 
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists, and blockers of voltage-gated calcium 
      channels, in the amygdala, may block these effects. There is also preliminary 
      evidence for the use of centrally acting beta-adrenergic antagonists, like 
      propranolol, to inhibit consolidation of traumatic memories in PTSD. Finally, 
      fear extinction, which entails new learning of fear inhibition, is central to the 
      mechanism of effective anti-anxiety treatments. Several pharmacological 
      manipulations, such as D-cycloserine, a partial NMDA agonist, have been found to 
      facilitate extinction. Combining these medication approaches with psychotherapies 
      that promote extinction, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), may offer 
      patients with anxiety disorders a rapid and robust treatment with good durability 
      of effect.

TI  - Evaluation of an open-access CBT-based Internet program for social anxiety: 
      Patterns of use, retention, and outcomes.
PG  - 988-999
LID - 10.1037/ccp0000232 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (ICBT) has been 
      established as both efficacious and effective in reducing symptoms of social 
      anxiety. However, most research has been conducted in controlled settings, and 
      little is known regarding the utility of such programs in an open-access format. 
      The present study examined the use, adherence, and effectiveness of Joyable, an 
      open-access, Internet-delivered, coach-supported CBT-based intervention for 
      social anxiety. METHOD: Participants were 3,384 registered users (Mage [SD] = 
      29.82 [7.89]; 54% male) that created an account between 2014 and 2016. 
      Characteristics of use, factors related to attrition and adherence, and 
      within-group outcomes were examined. The primary outcome measure was the Social 
      Phobia Inventory. RESULTS: On average, participants remained in the program for 
      81.02 days (SD = 60.50), during which they completed 12.14 activities (SD = 
      11.09) and 1.53 exposures (SD = 3.18). About half (57%) had contact with a coach. 
      Full adherence to the program was achieved by 16% of participants, a rate higher 
      than previously published open-access studies of ICBT. Social anxiety symptoms 
      were significantly reduced for participants that engaged in the program, with 
      medium within-group effects from baseline through the cognitive restructuring 
      module (d = 0.63-0.76) and large effects from baseline through the exposure 
      module (d = 1.40-1.83). Response rates were high (72%). Exposures and coach 
      contact were significant predictors of retention and outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      open-access online CBT-based program is effective in reducing social anxiety 
      symptoms and has the potential to extend Internet-based mental health services to 
      socially anxious individuals unwilling or unable to seek face-to-face 
      evidence-based therapy. (PsycINFO Database Record

AB  - BACKGROUND: Greater access to evidence-based psychological treatments is needed. 
      This review aimed to evaluate whether internet-delivered psychological treatments 
      for mood and anxiety disorders are efficacious, noninferior to established 
      treatments, safe, and cost-effective for children, adolescents and adults. 
      METHODS: We searched the literature for studies published until March 2013. 
      Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were considered for the assessment of 
      short-term efficacy and safety and were pooled in meta-analyses. Other designs 
      were also considered for long-term effect and cost-effectiveness. Comparisons 
      against established treatments were evaluated for noninferiority. Two reviewers 
      independently assessed the relevant studies for risk of bias. The quality of the 
      evidence was graded using an international grading system. RESULTS: A total of 52 
      relevant RCTs were identified whereof 12 were excluded due to high risk of bias. 
      Five cost-effectiveness studies were identified and three were excluded due to 
      high risk of bias. The included trials mainly evaluated internet-delivered 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (I-CBT) against a waiting list in adult volunteers 
      and 88% were conducted in Sweden or Australia. One trial involved children. For 
      adults, the quality of evidence was graded as moderate for the short-term 
      efficacy of I-CBT vs. waiting list for mild/moderate depression (d = 0.83; 95% CI 
      0.59, 1.07) and social phobia (d = 0.85; 95% CI 0.66, 1.05), and moderate for no 
      efficacy of internet-delivered attention bias modification vs. sham treatment for 
      social phobia (d =  -0.04; 95% CI -0.24, 0.35). The quality of evidence was 
      graded as low/very low for other disorders, interventions, children/adolescents, 
      noninferiority, adverse events, and cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: I-CBT is a 
      viable treatment option for adults with depression and some anxiety disorders who 
      request this treatment modality. Important questions remain before broad 
      implementation can be supported. Future research would benefit from prioritizing 
      adapting treatments to children/adolescents and using noninferiority designs with 
      established forms of treatment.

PG  - 29-33
AB  - Anxiety disorders in the United States are prevalent, widespread, and disabling. 
      These illnesses may account for almost one third of the $148 billion total mental 
      health bill each year. Pharmacologic options include tricyclic antidepressants, 
      monoamine oxidase inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and anxiolytics. Psychological 
      treatments include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), cognitive therapy, 
      exposure, and ritual prevention therapies. Despite insufficient evidence, many 
      experts recommend combined treatment, generally medication with CBT. A literature 
      review was conducted to examine studies with random assignment, adequate methods 
      and sample sizes, blind assessments, sufficient dosages and durations of 
      treatment, and satisfactory reporting of data, to determine whether combined 
      treatment was superior to monotherapy. Twenty-six randomized clinical trials were 
      identified; nine met review criteria. A review of relevant studies could not 
      confirm the superiority of combined treatment over monotherapy. In one of four 
      studies of obsessive-compulsive disorder, combined treatment produced better 
      results than monotherapy. There was no evidence of superiority for combined 
      therapy over monotherapy for the treatment of social phobia or generalized 
      anxiety disorder. There were no studies that met review criteria for either 
      specific phobia or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). With panic disorder, 
      there was evidence that combined treatment might actually lead to worse outcome. 
      Combined treatment is commonly recommended, but empirical support is limited. 
      More research is needed. There are few well-designed studies, and little data 
      regarding PTSD and specific phobias.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for 
      many children and adolescents with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), 
      therapeutic response is variable. Fear conditioning and extinction are central 
      constructs underlying exposure-based CBT. Fear extinction learning assessed prior 
      to CBT may be a useful predictor of CBT response for guiding treatment decisions. 
      METHODS: Sixty-four youth who participated in a randomized placebo-controlled 
      trial of CBT with and without d-cycloserine (DCS) completed a fear conditioning 
      task. Skin conductance response (SCR) scores were used to measure fear 
      acquisition and extinction to determine whether extinction learning could predict 
      CBT response. RESULTS: CBT responders and non-responders appeared to acquire 
      conditioned fear SCRs in a similar manner. However, differences between treatment 
      responders and non-responders emerged during the extinction phase. A responder 
      (responder, non-responder) by conditioned stimulus type (CS+, CS-) interaction 
      showed that CBT responders differentiated the stimulus paired with (CS+) and 
      without (CS-) the unconditioned stimulus correctly during early and late 
      extinction, whereas the CBT non-responders did not (p = .004). CONCLUSIONS: While 
      the small sample size makes conclusions tentative, this study supports an 
      emerging literature that differential fear extinction may be an important factor 
      underlying clinical correlates of pediatric OCD, including CBT response.

      Disorder.
PG  - 401-410
LID - 10.1159/000514073 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Data regarding the potential association between the outcome of 
      psychotherapy of panic disorder (PD) and biological parameters are few. In 21 (16 
      females) consecutively referred, medication-free, acutely ill PD outpatients, 
      without comorbidities, except agoraphobia, we systematically explored for 
      potential neuroendocrine and clinical correlates of response to a brief cognitive 
      behavior therapy (CBT). METHODS: Cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) 
      basal plasma levels were measured. Measures of psychopathology: (a) Symptom 
      Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), (b) Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement 
      (CGI-I) Scale, (c) Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire (ACQ), and (d) Mobility 
      Inventory (MI)-alone subscale. RESULTS: Nonresponders to CBT (CGI-I >2; N = 6) - 
      as compared to the responders (CGI-I ≤2; N = 15) - demonstrated significantly 
      higher cortisol and ACTH basal plasma concentrations. These differences were much 
      stronger when only female patients (nonresponders = 4; responders = 12) were 
      taken into consideration. Regarding psychopathology, nonresponders to CBT 
      suffered from more severe agoraphobia (MI-alone) at baseline. On the contrary, 
      more intense manifestations of anger (SCL-90-R) at baseline were associated with 
      a better treatment outcome. Response to CBT was associated with significant 
      reductions in all SCL-90-R subscales, more pronounced for "phobic anxiety" and 
      "anxiety" subscales. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that in acutely ill, 
      medication-free PD patients, response to CBT may be associated with certain 
      hormonal and clinical parameters at baseline.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study examines the effects of a single session of 
      Cognitive Bias Modification to induce positive Interpretative bias (CBM-I) using 
      standard or explicit instructions and an analogue of computer-administered CBT 
      (c-CBT) program on modifying cognitive biases and social anxiety. METHODS: A 
      sample of 76 volunteers with social anxiety attended a research site. At both 
      pre- and post-test, participants completed two computer-administered tests of 
      interpretative and attentional biases and a self-report measure of social 
      anxiety. Participants in the training conditions completed a single session of 
      either standard or explicit CBM-I positive training and a c-CBT program. 
      Participants in the Control (no training) condition completed a CBM-I neutral 
      task matched the active CBM-I intervention in format and duration but did not 
      encourage positive disambiguation of socially ambiguous or threatening scenarios. 
      RESULTS: Participants in both CBM-I programs (either standard or explicit 
      instructions) and the c-CBT condition exhibited more positive interpretations of 
      ambiguous social scenarios at post-test and one-week follow-up as compared to the 
      Control condition. Moreover, the results showed that CBM-I and c-CBT, to some 
      extent, changed negative attention biases in a positive direction. Furthermore, 
      the results showed that both CBM-I training conditions and c-CBT reduced social 
      anxiety symptoms at one-week follow-up. LIMITATIONS: This study used a single 
      session of CBM-I training, however multi-sessions intervention might result in 
      more endurable positive CBM-I changes. CONCLUSIONS: A computerised single session 
      of CBM-I and an analogue of c-CBT program reduced negative interpretative biases 
      and social anxiety.

TI  - Treating medication-resistant panic disorder: predictors and outcome of 
      cognitive-behavior therapy in a Brazilian public hospital.
PG  - 43-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Brazil, treatment of panic disorder is most frequently initiated 
      with pharmacotherapy, but only half of the patients can be expected to be panic 
      free after medication. Studies have suggested that individual or group 
      cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment strategy for panic 
      patients who have failed to respond to pharmacotherapy. METHODS: Thirty-two 
      patients diagnosed with panic disorder with agoraphobia having residual symptoms 
      despite being on an adequate dose of medication were treated with 12 weeks of 
      group CBT. The outcome was evaluated for panic frequency and severity, 
      generalized anxiety, and global severity. Comorbid conditions, a childhood 
      history of anxiety, and defense mechanism styles were assessed as potential 
      predictors of treatment response. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients completed the 
      12-week protocol. Treatment was associated with significant reductions in symptom 
      severity on all outcome measures (p < 0.001). Patients with depression had a 
      poorer outcome of the treatment (p = 0.01) as did patients using more neurotic (p 
      = 0.002) and immature defenses (p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Consistent with previous 
      reports, we found that CBT was effective for our sample of treatment-resistant 
      patients. Among these patients, depression as well as neurotic defense style was 
      associated with a poorer outcome. The use of CBT in Brazil for 
      treatment-resistant and other panic patients is encouraged.

TI  - Context in the clinic: how well do cognitive-behavioral therapies and medications 
      work in combination?
PG  - 987-97
AB  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy demonstrate efficacy 
      across the anxiety disorders, but recognition of their limitations has sparked 
      interest in combining modalities to maximize benefit. This article reviews the 
      empirical literature to examine whether combining treatments influences efficacy 
      of either monotherapy. We conducted a comprehensive literature search of 
      published randomized trials that compared combined treatment with pharmacologic 
      or CBT monotherapies. Ten studies that met our inclusion criteria were reviewed 
      in detail, and within-subjects effect sizes were calculated to compare treatment 
      conditions within and across studies. At posttreatment and follow-up, effect size 
      and percentage responder data failed to clearly demonstrate an advantage or 
      disadvantage of combined treatment over CBT alone for obsessive-compulsive 
      disorder, social phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder. Some advantage of 
      combined treatment over pharmacotherapy alone emerged from the few studies that 
      allowed for such a direct comparison. In contrast, combined treatment for panic 
      disorder seems to provide an advantage over CBT alone at posttreatment, but is 
      associated with greater relapse after treatment discontinuation. The advantage of 
      combined treatment may vary across the anxiety disorders. The potential 
      differences in usefulness of combined treatment are discussed, directions for 
      future research are suggested, and implications for clinical practice are 
      considered.

TI  - Review of the long-term effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy compared to 
      medications in panic disorder.
PG  - 58-64
AB  - Panic disorder is a recurrent and disabling illness. It is believed that 
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has a long-term protective effect for this 
      disorder. This would offer CBT considerable advantage over medication management 
      of panic disorder, as patients often relapse when they are tapered off their 
      medications. This is a review of the literature about the long-term effectiveness 
      of CBT. We searched for follow-up studies of panic disorder using CBT. Of the 78 
      citations produced in the initial search, most had major methodological flaws, 
      including ignoring losses to follow-up, not accounting for interval treatment, 
      and unclear reporting. Three papers met strict methodological criteria, and two 
      of these demonstrated a modest protective effect of CBT in panic disorder 
      patients. We make recommendations for well-designed studies involving comparisons 
      of medications and cognitive behavior therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of adverse events (AEs) across 4 treatment 
      conditions in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS), and to 
      compare the frequency of AEs between children and adolescents. METHOD: 
      Participants ages 7 to 17 years (mean = 10.7 years) meeting the DSM-IV criteria 
      for 1 or more of the following disorders: separation anxiety disorder, 
      generalized anxiety disorder, or social phobia were randomized (2:2:2:1) to 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT, n = 139), sertraline (SRT, n = 133), a 
      combination of both (COMB, n = 140), or pill placebo (PBO, n = 76). Data on AEs 
      were collected via a standardized inquiry method plus a self-report Physical 
      Symptom Checklist (PSC). RESULTS: There were no differences between the 
      double-blinded conditions (SRT versus PBO) for total physical and psychiatric AEs 
      or any individual physical or psychiatric AEs. The rates of total physical AEs 
      were greater in the SRT-alone treatment condition when compared to CBT (p < .01) 
      and COMB (p < .01). Moreover, those who received SRT alone reported higher rates 
      of several physical AEs when compared to COMB and CBT. The rate of total 
      psychiatric AEs was higher in children (≤12 years) across all arms (31.7% versus 
      23.1%, p < .05). Total PSC scores decreased over time, with no significant 
      differences between treatment groups. CONCLUSION: The results support the 
      tolerability/safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment 
      for anxiety disorders even after adjusting for the number of reporting 
      opportunities, leading to no differences in overall rates of AEs. Few differences 
      occurred on specific items. Additional monitoring of psychiatric AEs is 
      recommended in children (≤12 years). Clinical trial registration

      panic disorder and/or agoraphobia? A systematic review and meta-analysis.

LID - S0165-0327(20)32456-3 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is no meta-analysis that specifically evaluates the 
      effectiveness of Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) in adults with 
      diagnosed panic disorder and/or agoraphobia (PD/A) so far. The current 
      meta-analysis aims to fill this gap (PROSPERO CRD 42016034016). METHODS: 
      Systematic literature searches in six databases for randomised and controlled 
      clinical trials investigating IMIs in adults, who met diagnostic criteria for 
      PD/A. Study selection and data extraction were conducted independently by two 
      reviewers. Random-effects meta-analyses, pre-planned subgroup and sensitivity 
      analyses were conducted when appropriate. Primary outcomes were PD and A symptom 
      severity. In addition, adherence, response, remission, quality of life, anxiety 
      and depression symptom severity were examined. RESULTS: A total of 16 trials 
      (1015 patients), with 21 comparisons (9 IMI vs. waitlist; 7 IMI vs. IMI; 5 IMI 
      vs. active treatment condition), were included. IMIs revealed beneficial effects 
      on panic (Hedges' g range -2.61 to -0.25) and agoraphobia symptom severity when 
      compared to waitlist (pooled g = -1.15, [95%-CI = -1.56; -0.74]). Studies 
      comparing IMIs to active controls (i.e., face-to-face CBT and applied relaxation) 
      did not find significant differences for reductions in panic (g = -0.02, 
      [95%-CI = -0.25; 0.21]) and agoraphobia symptom severity (g = -0.10, 
      [95%-CI = -0.39; 0.19]). Furthermore, IMIs were superior to waitlist controls 
      regarding anxiety and depression symptom severity and quality of life. 
      LIMITATIONS: Tests for publication bias were not feasible due to the limited 
      number of trials per comparison, and the risk of bias assessment indicated some 
      methodological shortcomings. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this meta-analytic review 
      provide support for the effectiveness of IMIs in patients with verified PD/A. 
      However, before IMIs can be included in treatment guidelines for PD/A, future 
      high quality research is needed that substantiates and extends the evidence base, 
      especially in regard to intervention safety.

TI  - The efficacy of internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy for social anxiety 
      disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 656-668
LID - 10.1002/cpp.2528 [doi]
AB  - Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most common lifelong anxiety 
      disorders. Although cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has proven to be 
      effective in treating people with SAD, it may not be available for a considerable 
      proportion of patients. Internet-based CBT (ICBT) is more accessible than 
      face-to-face treatment. This meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy of ICBT in 
      patients with SAD. We searched five databases, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register 
      of Controlled Trials, Health Management Information Consortium, Ovid MEDLINE and 
      EMBASE, and identified 20 eligible randomized controlled trials published from 
      inception to 25 July 2020, with the outcome data from 1,743 participants. The 
      results indicated that ICBT had a significant positive effect on patients with 
      SAD compared with the control groups (g = -0.55). A subgroup analysis revealed 
      that ICBT and CBT had an equal effect on treating patients with SAD (g = -0.18). 
      There was also no difference between ICBT and ICBT plus other therapies in the 
      treatment of patients with SAD (g = -0.07). The effect size of ICBT on patients 
      with SAD was maintained at the 6-month follow-up (g = -0.08) and at the 12-month 
      follow-up (g = -0.17). The findings of this review demonstrated that ICBT can 
      significantly reduce SAD symptoms and that ICBT and face-to-face CBT produce 
      equivalent effects. The results of this meta-analysis contributed to the 
      literature on ICBT for the treatment of patients with SAD, although numerous 
      aspects of ICBT were identified for future investigations.

TI  - Pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder at the turn of the millennium.
PG  - 783-803
AB  - Over the past 21 years since the birth of SP into the diagnostic nomenclature, 
      there have been significant gains in knowledge about effective pharmacologic and 
      psychotherapeutic treatments. The SSRIs have emerged as the first-line 
      pharmacologic treatment, although good evidence shows efficacy of 
      benzodiazepines; MAOIs; and anticonvulsant agents, such as gabapentin and 
      pregabalin. There is also emerging evidence about the efficacy of the novel 
      antidepressant venlafaxine and also optimism for the potential utility of 
      nefazodone and possibly bupropion. However, there are many areas requiring 
      further investigation. There has been a great deal of excitement about the 
      publication of the RUPP Anxiety Study, demonstrating efficacy for fluvoxamine in 
      socially phobic youth. Given that SP starts in childhood and adolescence, more 
      data are needed to support the use of pharmacotherapy in this age group because 
      early intervention may prevent the sequelae of chronic SP. There needs to be more 
      investigation into what is required for social phobic individuals who obtain a 
      good response to pharmacotherapy to move into full-remission status. Additional 
      research is needed regarding the evaluation of the comparative efficacy of 
      different drug classes and to develop an improved capability of predicting 
      treatment response to a particular type of treatment. In addition, more research 
      is needed regarding treatment resistance. In most of the anxiety disorders that 
      have been studied, combining CBT with psychopharmacologic treatment has shown 
      little advantage over either treatment alone. These findings may be due to 
      methodologic problems. Research is needed on how to sequence treatments to 
      maximize the benefits of combining the two types of effective treatments 
      together. Finally, many clinicians are seeing an emerging trend of individuals 
      who have had untreated SP all of their lives and are now presenting for treatment 
      in their "golden years." The current established treatments need to be evaluated 
      further in this geriatric population.

TI  - Cognitive behavioral therapy for postpartum panic disorder: a case series.
PG  - 53
LID - 10.1186/s40359-019-0330-z [doi]
LID - 53
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical anxiety is common during the perinatal period, and anxiety 
      symptoms often persist after childbirth. Ten to 30 % of perinatal women are 
      diagnosed with panic disorder (PD)-far more than the 1.5-3% rate among the 
      general population. Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been 
      determined to be an effective treatment for PD, few studies have been conducted 
      on CBT effectiveness in treating postpartum PD and, to the best of the knowledge 
      of the present authors, no research has been conducted on postpartum PD among 
      Japanese women. In this manuscript, we report on our administration of CBT to 
      three postpartum patients with PD, detailing the improvement in their symptoms. 
      CASE PRESENTATION: All patients in this study were married, in their thirties, 
      and diagnosed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview as having 
      PD with agoraphobia. The Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) was used to 
      evaluate patients' panic symptoms and their severity. All patients received a 
      total of 16 weekly 50-min sessions of CBT, and all completed the treatment. All 
      patients were exceedingly preoccupied with the perception that a "mother must 
      protect her child," which reinforced the fear that "the continuation of their 
      perinatal symptoms would prevent them from rearing their children". After 
      treatment, all participants' panic symptoms were found to have decreased 
      according to the PDSS, and two no longer met clinical criteria: Chihiro's score 
      changed from 13 to 3, Beth's PDSS score at baseline from 22 to 6, and Tammy's 
      score changed from 7 to 1. CONCLUSIONS: CBT provides a therapeutic effect and is 
      a feasible method for treating postpartum PD. It is important that therapists 
      prescribe tasks that patients can perform collaboratively with their children.

AB  - This study examined (a) demographic and clinical characteristics associated with 
      sleep-related problems (SRPs) among youth with anxiety disorders, and (b) the 
      impact of anxiety treatment: cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT; Coping Cat), 
      medication (sertraline), their combination, and pill placebo on SRPs. Youth 
      (N = 488, ages 7-17, 50% female, 79% White) with a principal diagnosis of 
      generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, or social phobia 
      participated. SRPs were reported by parents and youth. Findings differed by 
      informant and by type of SRP, with evidence that SRPs are associated with age, 
      anxiety severity, externalizing problems, functional impairment, and family 
      burden at pretreatment. Anxiety treatment reduced SRPs; effect sizes were small 
      to medium. Reductions in parent-reported separation-related sleep difficulties 
      were significantly greater in active treatment than in the placebo condition, 
      with the greatest reductions reported by parents of youth whose active treatment 
      was multimodal or included sertraline. Youth whose anxiety treatment involved CBT 
      reported significantly greater decreases in dysregulated sleep (e.g., 
      sleeplessness). Both CBT for anxiety and sertraline appear to be somewhat 
      effective in reducing SRPs, and multimodal treatment may be preferable depending 
      on the symptom presentation. To inform practice, future research should examine a 
      broad range of SRPs, incorporate objective measures of sleep, and evaluate the 
      impact of behavioral strategies that directly target SRPs in youth with anxiety 
      disorders.

TI  - The effect of Korean-group cognitive behavioural therapy among patients with 
      panic disorder in clinic settings.
PG  - 28-40
LID - 10.1111/jpm.12337 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Panic disorder patients display various 
      panic-related physical symptoms and catastrophic misinterpretation of bodily 
      sensations, which lower their quality of life by interfering with daily 
      activities. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a useful strategy for panic 
      disorder patients to manage symptoms associated with inaccurate cognitive 
      interpretation of situations resulting from the patient's cognitive 
      vulnerability. In South Korea, however, despite the increasing prevalence of 
      panic disorder, CBT is not a common element of nursing care plans for panic 
      disorder patients. Moreover, few Korean researchers have attempted to assess the 
      effects of CBT on such patients. WHAT THIS PAPER ADD TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: In a 
      strategy combining CBT and routine treatments, patients with panic disorder can 
      experience greater positive effects in the acute treatment phase than those they 
      experience when receiving only routine treatment. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR 
      PRACTICE?: Mental health professionals, especially psychiatric nurses in local 
      clinics who operate most special mental health programmes for panic disorder 
      patients, should apply a panic disorder management programme that integrates CBT 
      and routine treatments. The integrated approach is more effective for reducing 
      the number of panic attacks and cognitive misinterpretation in patients than 
      providing routine treatment alone. For patients with panic disorder, the 
      objective of CBT is to understand the relationship between psychological panic 
      disorder sensations, emotions, thoughts and behaviours. Therefore, nurses can 
      help patients address and improve biological, social and psychological aspects of 
      physical health problems as well as help them improve their coping skills in 
      general. ABSTRACT: Introduction In panic disorder, sensitivity to bodily 
      sensations increases due to the patient's cognitive vulnerability. Cognitive 
      behavioural therapy (CBT) can help to decrease sensitivity to bodily sensations 
      by correcting these cognitive distortions by controlling negative thoughts and 
      panic attacks. Aims This study verified whether group CBT is more effective than 
      treatment as usual (TAU) in South Korean patients with panic disorder. Methods 
      The study participants consisted of 76 panic disorder patients. Patients in the 
      therapy condition attended sessions once a week for a total of 12 sessions in 
      addition to drug treatment. Results In the therapy condition, there were 
      significant decreases in panic-related bodily sensations and ranking and belief 
      scores for catastrophic misinterpretation of external events. Discussion Group 
      CBT, in comparison to TAU, decreases panic and agoraphobia symptom severity in 
      South Korean patients with panic disorder. Our study provides evidence for the 
      effectiveness of a panic disorder management programme that integrates group CBT 
      and traditional pharmacotherapeutic treatment for patients with panic disorder. 
      Implications for Practice The cognitive behavioural approach is needed to reduce 
      panic and agoraphobia symptoms for hospitalized patients with panic disorder more 
      than activity therapies, medications and supportive counselling by doctors and 
      nurses.

      an Indian study.
PG  - 513-25
LID - 10.1017/S1352465813000635 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: CBT has been proven to be effective in the treatment of panic 
      disorder; however, attempts to study the process of change are limited. AIM: The 
      study evaluated the temporal patterns of change in the panic symptoms, 
      cognitions, behaviours, and anxiety sensitivity in subjects with panic disorder 
      being treated with CBT. METHOD: Thirty subjects with panic disorder were 
      allocated to two groups: Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT, n = 15) and Behaviour 
      Therapy (BT, n = 15). Assessments were carried out weekly for five consecutive 
      weeks using the Semi-Structured Interview Schedule, the Anxiety Sensitivity 
      Index, the Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire, and the Texas Panic Attack 
      Record Form. The CBT group received comprehensive CBT and the BT group received 
      psycho-education and Applied Relaxation. RESULTS: Following intervention the 
      change was continuous and gradual on all the variables in the CBT group and the 
      scores reduced to a functional range after 4-5 weeks of therapy. Such a change 
      was not evident in the BT group. Significant change was evident in cognitive 
      domains following the introduction of the exposure and cognitive restructuring 
      within the CBT group. Both cognitive and behavioural techniques contributed to 
      the overall change. CONCLUSION: CBT had an impact on the cognitive domains and 
      significant changes were evident corresponding to the addition of cognitive 
      restructuring and exposure techniques in the 3rd to 5th week. Both cognitive and 
      behavioural components are therefore crucial for overall improvement to occur.

TI  - The Effect of Personality Traits on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Outcomes in 
      Student Pharmacists with Rat Phobia: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 23-31
LID - 10.30476/ijms.2019.82341.1045 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about which personality traits determine the 
      effectiveness of various types of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) on animal 
      phobia. The objective of the present study was to investigate a possible 
      association between personality traits and the outcome of single- and 
      multi-session CBT. METHODS: The present randomized clinical trial was conducted 
      from November 2018 to May 2019 in Shiraz, Iran. Forty female students with rat 
      phobia, who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) 
      criteria, were systematically allocated into a single- and a multi-session 
      therapy group (odd numbers one-session treatment, even numbers multi-session 
      treatment). In both groups, the students were gradually exposed to rats as part 
      of the treatment. Psychological measures (state-anxiety, rat phobia, and disgust 
      questionnaires) were used to compare pre- and post-intervention outcomes. 
      Multivariate analysis of covariance was used to assess which personality traits 
      influenced the intervention outcome. The statistical analysis was performed using 
      SPSS (version 20.0) and P values&lt;0.05 were considered statistically 
      significant. RESULTS: Rat phobia was positively and significantly affected by 
      conscientiousness (P=0.001) and agreeableness (P=0.003). Of these personality 
      traits, only a higher degree of conscientiousness resulted in a further reduction 
      of state anxiety after the intervention (P=0.005). There were no significant 
      differences between the pre- and post-intervention outcomes. CONCLUSION: The 
      outcome of single- and multi-session rat phobia therapies was associated with 
      specific personality traits of the participants, namely conscientiousness and 
      agreeableness. Both intervention methods had an equal effect on reducing rat 
      phobia.

TI  - Medical student attitudes and educational interventions to prevent neurophobia: a 
      longitudinal study.
PG  - 225

AB  - BACKGROUND: With an aging American population, the burden of neurologic disease 
      is intensifying and the decline in neurology residents and practicing 
      neurologists is leaving these patients helpless and unable to find care. 
      'Neurophobia', a chronic illness that begins early in medical school, has been 
      identified as a cause for the low number of neurology residents. METHODS: A 
      longitudinal study surveyed medical students at the beginning of their first year 
      (M1) and then again at the beginning of their second year (M2). Three 
      neuroscience educational interventions were studied: team based learning (TBL), 
      case based teaching (CBT), and problem based learning (PBL). Participants 
      provided self-reported neurophobia levels, attitudes about neuroscience, and the 
      effectiveness of educational interventions. RESULTS: A total of 446 students 
      during M1 and 206 students during M2 participated in the survey. A significant 
      change in self-reported neurophobia (p = 0.035) was observed from 19% in M1 to 
      26% in M2. Neuroscience knowledge and confidence managing a neurologic condition 
      also significantly increased (p < 0.001 and p = 0.038 respectively). Perceived 
      interest, difficulty, and desire to pursue a career in neuroscience did not a 
      change significantly. Majority of students perceived CBT (76%), TBL (56%), and 
      PBL (66%) beneficial. Only CBT demonstrated a statistical difference (p = 0.026) 
      when stratified by self-reported change in neurophobia. CONCLUSION: An increase 
      in neurophobia after completing a neuroscience was observed but the prevalence 
      rate of 26% was lower than previous studies. Knowledge about neuroscience 
      increased significantly and educational interventions were considered beneficial 
      by students. Thus, interventions that increase knowledge and decrease neurophobia 
      can lead to an increase in students pursuing neurology residencies.

TI  - The impact of treatment delivery format on response to cognitive behaviour 
      therapy for preadolescent children with anxiety disorders.
PG  - 763-772
LID - 10.1111/jcpp.12872 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several delivery formats of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for 
      child anxiety have been proposed, however, there is little consensus on the 
      optimal delivery format. The primary goal of this study was to investigate the 
      impact of the child's primary anxiety diagnosis on changes in clinical severity 
      (of the primary problem) during individual CBT, group CBT and guided parent-led 
      CBT. The secondary goal was to investigate the impact of the child's primary 
      anxiety diagnosis on rates of remission for the three treatment formats. METHODS: 
      A sample of 1,253 children (5-12 years; Mage = 9.3, SD = 1.7) was pooled from CBT 
      trials carried out at 10 sites. Children had a primary diagnosis of generalised 
      anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SoAD), specific phobia (SP) or 
      separation anxiety disorder (SAD). Children and parents completed a 
      semistructured clinical interview to assess the presence and severity of DSM-IV 
      psychiatric disorders at preintervention, postintervention and follow-up. Linear 
      mixture modelling was used to evaluate the primary research question and logistic 
      modelling was used to investigate the secondary research question. RESULTS: In 
      children with primary GAD, SAD or SoAD, there were no significant differences 
      between delivery formats. However, children with primary SP showed significantly 
      larger reductions in clinical severity following individual CBT compared to group 
      CBT and guided parent-led CBT. The results were mirrored in the analysis of 
      remission responses with the exception that individual CBT was no longer superior 
      to group CBT for children with a primary SP. The difference between individual 
      and group was not significant when follow-up data were examined separately. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Data show there may be greater clinical benefit by allocating 
      children with a primary SP to individual CBT, although future research on 
      cost-effectiveness is needed to determine whether the additional clinical 
      benefits justify the additional resources required.

TI  - The Impact of Treatment Expectations on Exposure Process and Treatment Outcome in 
      Childhood Anxiety Disorders.
PG  - 79-89
LID - 10.1007/s10802-019-00574-x [doi]
AB  - This study examined the relationship between caregivers' and youths' treatment 
      expectations and characteristics of exposure tasks (quantity, mastery, 
      compliance) in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for childhood anxiety. 
      Additionally, compliance with exposure tasks was tested as a mediator of the 
      relationship between treatment expectations and symptom improvement. Data were 
      from youth (N = 279; 7-17 years old) enrolled in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety 
      Multimodal Study (CAMS) and randomized to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or 
      the combination of CBT and sertraline for the treatment of separation anxiety 
      disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social phobia. Caregivers and youth 
      independently reported treatment expectations prior to randomization, anxiety was 
      assessed pre- and post-treatment by independent evaluators blind to treatment 
      condition, and exposure characteristics were recorded by the cognitive-behavioral 
      therapists following each session. For both caregivers and youths, more positive 
      expectations that anxiety would improve with treatment were associated with 
      greater compliance with exposure tasks, and compliance mediated the relationship 
      between treatment expectations and change in anxiety symptoms following 
      treatment. Additionally, more positive parent treatment expectations were related 
      to a greater number and percentage of sessions with exposure. More positive youth 
      treatment expectations were associated with greater mastery during sessions 
      focused on exposure. Findings underscore the importance of addressing parents' 
      and youths' treatment expectations at the outset of therapy to facilitate

TI  - The German Guidelines for the treatment of anxiety disorders: first revision.
PG  - 571-582
LID - 10.1007/s00406-021-01324-1 [doi]
AB  - Starting in 2019, the 2014 German Guidelines for Anxiety Disorders (Bandelow et 
      al. Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci 265:363-373, 2015) have been revised by a 
      consensus group consisting of 35 experts representing the 29 leading German 
      specialist societies and patient self-help organizations. While the first version 
      of the guideline was based on 403 randomized controlled studies (RCTs), 92 
      additional RCTs have been included in this revision. According to the consensus 
      committee, anxiety disorders should be treated with psychotherapy, 
      pharmacological drugs, or their combination. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
      was regarded as the psychological treatment with the highest level of evidence. 
      Psychodynamic therapy (PDT) was recommended when CBT was not effective or 
      unavailable or when PDT was preferred by the patient informed about more 
      effective alternatives. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and 
      serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are recommended as first-line 
      drugs for anxiety disorders. Medications should be continued for 6-12 months 
      after remission. When either medications or psychotherapy were not effective, 
      treatment should be switched to the other approach or to their combination. For 
      patients non-responsive to standard treatments, a number of alternative 
      strategies have been suggested. An individual treatment plan should consider 
      efficacy, side effects, costs and the preference of the patient. Changes in the 
      revision include recommendations regarding virtual reality exposure therapy, 
      Internet interventions and systemic therapy. The recommendations are not only 
      applicable for Germany but may also be helpful for developing treatment plans in 
      all other countries.

AB  - There is a paucity of research on the role of COVID-19 related fear and lockdown 
      on social anxiety disorder (SAD). In a follow-up study during post-lockdown 
      period, we compared social anxiety of individuals with SAD who received 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) versus psychoeducational-supportive therapy 
      (PST) before the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact of COVID-19 related fear. 
      Social anxiety severity was rated by the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) at 
      pre-intervention, post-intervention, and post-lockdown periods. Fear of COVID-19 
      was assessed during the post-lockdown period. The treatment effects in the CBT 
      group (n = 33) were significantly better than the PST group (n = 32) at 
      post-intervention; this was maintained at 14-months following intervention 
      despite COVID-related lockdown. In the PST group, there was no change following 
      the intervention; and the social phobia increased after lockdown. The CBT group 
      had significantly less COVID-19 related fear than the PST group. Social anxiety 
      was positively correlated with fear of COVID-19; and individuals with 
      comorbidities had significantly more fear. Using the hierarchical multiple 
      regression, SPIN post-intervention, COVID-19 fear, and duration of SAD predicted 
      social anxiety severity during the post-lockdown period. In conclusion, the 
      effect of CBT for SAD was maintained through lockdown and was associated with 
      significantly less COVID-19 related fear.

TI  - School-based interventions for anxious children.
PG  - 1118-27
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of three school-based interventions for 
      anxious children: group cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for children, group 
      CBT for children plus parent training group, and no-treatment control. METHOD: 
      Students (7-11 years old) in three elementary schools (N = 453) were screened 
      using the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children and teacher nomination. 
      Subsequently, 101 identified children and their parents completed the Anxiety 
      Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV, Child Version. Children with features or 
      DSM-IV diagnoses of separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, 
      and/or social phobia (n = 61) were randomized by school to one of three 
      conditions. Active treatments were nine weekly sessions of either group CBT or 
      group CBT plus concurrent parent training. RESULTS: Clinician-report, 
      child-report, and parent-report measures of child anxiety demonstrated 
      significant benefits of CBT treatments over the no-treatment control group. 
      Effect size was 0.58 for change in composite clinician severity rating, the 
      primary outcome measure, favoring collapsed CBT conditions compared with control. 
      In addition, several instruments showed significantly greater improvement in 
      child anxiety for group CBT plus parent training over group CBT alone. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Both active CBT treatments were more effective than the no-treatment 
      control condition in decreasing child anxiety symptoms and associated impairment. 
      When parent training was combined with child group CBT, there were some 
      additional benefits for the children.

TI  - Sensitization of catastrophic cognition in cognitive-behavioral therapy for panic 
      disorder.
PG  - 70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive model of panic disorder have proposed that panic attacks 
      result from the catastrophic misinterpretation of certain bodily sensations. 
      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for panic disorder aims to change these 
      catastrophic cognitions. CBT intervention successfully caused reduction of 
      catastrophic cognitions and symptomatic improvement in the majority of cases. 
      However there are some patients who fail to modify their catastrophic cognitions 
      or rather experience an increase in them during CBT treatment. It is clinically 
      and theoretically important to understand about cognitive sensitization of panic 
      disorder during CBT sessions. The purpose of the present study is 1) to clarify 
      the baseline characteristics of panic patients who would experience sensitization 
      of their catastrophic cognitions through the CBT treatment, and 2) to examine the 
      course of symptomatic changes for them. METHODS: Of ninety-five outpatients with 
      panic disorder started the group CBT program for treatment of panic disorder, 
      seventy-nine completer were classified as "cognitively sensitized (CS)" or 
      "cognitive responding (CR)" or "no-responder" according to the difference of the 
      Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire score across treatment. We compared the CS 
      and CR patients in terms of their baseline clinical characteristics. Then we 
      assessed the symptomatic and functional changes for both groups. RESULTS: At the 
      start of the CBT program, despite of the same degree of panic disorder severity, 
      CS scored significantly lower on ACQ score than CR. CS also showed significantly 
      lower score on anticipatory anxiety compared to CR. At the end of treatment CS 
      showed significant improvement in severity of panic disorder, although the degree 
      of improvement was smaller than that for CR. Then CS would progressively reduce 
      their agoraphobic fear and avoidance, and would improve their functional 
      impairment up to three month of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Panic patients who would 
      experience sensitization of their catastrophic cognitions through the CBT 
      treatment could nonetheless gradually improve. They showed a relatively low level 
      of catastrophic cognition and anticipatory anxiety before starting the CBT 
      program. We might conclude that temporary sensitization of catastrophic cognition 
      may be necessary before improvement especially among those with initially low 
      catastrophic body sensation fears and that we need not be concerned too much with 
      temporary increase in catastrophic cognition in the process of CBT for panic 
      disorder.

TI  - Is a combined therapy more effective than either CBT or SSRI alone? Results of a 
      multicenter trial on panic disorder with or without agoraphobia.
PG  - 260-70

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish whether the combination of cognitive-behavioral therapy 
      (CBT) and pharmacotherapy (SSRI) was more effective in treating panic disorder 
      (PD) than either CBT or SSRI alone, and to evaluate any differential effects 
      between the mono-treatments. METHOD: Patients with PD (n = 150) with or without 
      agoraphobia received CBT, SSRI or CBT + SSRI. Outcome was assessed after 9 
      months, before medication taper. RESULTS: CBT + SSRI was clearly superior to CBT 
      in both completer and intent-to-treat analysis (ITT). Completer analysis revealed 
      superiority of CBT + SSRI over SSRI on three measures and no differences between 
      CBT and SSRI. ITT analysis revealed superiority of SSRI over CBT on four measures 
      and no differences between CBT + SSRI and SSRI. CONCLUSION: Both the 
      mono-treatments (CBT and SSRI) and the combined treatment (CBT + SSRI) proved to 
      be effective treatments for PD. At post-test, CBT + SSRI was clearly superior to 
      CBT, but differences between CBT + SSRI and SSRI, and between SSRI and CBT, were 
      small.

TI  - Sleep quality predicts treatment outcome in CBT for social anxiety disorder.
PG  - 1114-20
LID - 10.1002/da.22170 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep quality may be an important, yet relatively neglected, 
      predictor of treatment outcome in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety 
      disorders. Specifically, poor sleep quality may impair memory consolidation of 
      in-session extinction learning. We therefore examined sleep quality as a 
      predictor of treatment outcome in CBT for social anxiety disorder and the impact 
      of d-cycloserine (DCS) on this relationship. METHODS: One hundred sixty-nine 
      participants with a primary diagnosis of DSM-IV generalized social anxiety 
      disorder were recruited across three sites. Participants were enrolled in 12 
      weeks of group CBT. Participants randomly received 50 mg of DCS (n = 87) or pill 
      placebo (n = 82) 1 hr prior to sessions 3-7. Participants completed a baseline 
      measure of self-reported sleep quality and daily diaries recording subjective 
      feelings of being rested upon wakening. Outcome measures including social anxiety 
      symptoms and global severity scores were assessed at each session. RESULTS: 
      Poorer baseline sleep quality was associated with slower improvement and higher 
      posttreatment social anxiety symptom and severity scores. Moreover, patients who 
      felt more "rested" after sleeping the night following a treatment session had 
      lower levels of symptoms and global severity at the next session, controlling for 
      their symptoms and severity scores the previous session. Neither of these effects 
      were moderated by DCS condition. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that poor 
      sleep quality diminishes the effects of CBT for social anxiety disorder and this 
      relation is not attenuated by DCS administration. Therapeutic attention to sleep 
      quality prior to initiation of CBT and during the acute treatment phase may be 
      clinically indicated.

TI  - INTERNET-DELIVERED LOW-INTENSITY CBT FOR PEOPLE WITH SOCIAL ANXIETY DISORDER IN A 
      PERIOD OF COVID-19: RESULTS OF PILOT RESEARCH.
PG  - 3109-3114
LID - 10.36740/WLek202212136 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim: The study aims to provide evidence of the effectiveness of 
      online low-intensity CBT-based psychological interventions on the psychological 
      well-being of people with social anxiety disorders and related impairments in the 
      COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: 222 volunteers 
      aged 18-35 years included in study: low-intensity CBT group (n=106) and control 
      group (n=116). To assess the mental health prob¬lems were used International 
      Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and a set of IAPT scales. Analyses considered 
      levels of pre-post intervention effect sizes and clinically significant 
      improvement of symptoms of social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, 
      depression, and distress in maintaining general and work activity scores. 
      RESULTS: Results: Comparisons between the low-intensity interventions group and 
      control (self-help guide psychological care as usual) indicated more reduction in 
      the severity of symp¬toms of social anxiety disorder and comorbid impairments 
      associated with depression or generalized anxiety disorder. Changes for social 
      phobia and other outcomes indicate that the odds of relapse or exacerbation of 
      symptoms in the control group are more significant than those after a CBT-based 
      low-intensity psychosocial care program. Analysis showed a significant 
      interaction between outcomes scores and the number of sessions: more than five 
      online sessions and homework with a self-help guide improved outcome. CONCLUSION: 
      Conclusions: This pilot trial provides initial evidence that low-intensity online 
      interventions based on CBT result in reductions in psychological problems for 
      persons with a social anxiety disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Stepped-care (SC) models for anxiety disorders are implemented on a large scale 
      and are assumed to be as effective for the greater majority of patients as more 
      intensive treatment schemes. To compare the outcomes of SC and international 
      guideline-based treatment (Treatment as Usual: TAU) for panic disorder, a total 
      of 128 patients were randomized to either SC or TAU (ratio 2: 1, respectively) 
      using a computer generated algorithm. They were treated in four mental health 
      care centres in the Netherlands after therapists had been trained in SC by a 
      senior expert therapist. SC comprised 10-week guided self-help (pen-and-paper 
      version) followed, if indicated, by 13-week manualized face-to-face cognitive 
      behavioural therapy (CBT), with medication- if prescribed- kept constant. TAU 
      consisted of 23-week regular face-to-face CBT (RCBT) with medication -when 
      prescribed- also kept constant. The means of the attended sessions in the SC 
      condition was 5.9 (SD = 4.8) for ITT and 9.6 (SD = 9.6) for the RCBT condition. 
      The difference in the number of attended sessions between the conditions was 
      significant (t(126) = -3.87, p < .001). Remission rates between treatment 
      conditions did not differ significantly (SC: 44.5%; RCBT: 53.3%) and symptom 
      reduction was similar. Stepping up SC treatment to face-to-face CBT showed a 
      minimal additional effect. Importantly, drop-out rates differed significantly for 
      the two conditions (SC: 48.2%; RCBT: 26.7%). SC was effective in the treatment of 
      panic disorder in terms of symptom reduction and remission rate, but dropout 
      rates were twice as high as those seen in RCBT, with the second phase of SC not 
      substantially improving treatment response. However, SC required significantly 
      less therapist contact time compared to RCBT, and more research is needed to 
      explore predictors of success for guided self-help interventions to allow 
      treatment intensity to be tailored to patients' needs and preferences.

TI  - Adequacy of treatment received by primary care patients with anxiety disorders.
PG  - 443-50
LID - 10.1002/da.22209 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined the adequacy of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy 
      received by primary care patients with anxiety disorders over up to 5 years of 
      follow-up. METHOD: Five hundred thirty-four primary care patients at 15 US sites, 
      who screened positive for anxiety symptoms, were assessed for anxiety disorders. 
      Those meeting anxiety disorder criteria were offered participation and 
      interviewed again at six and 12 months postintake, and yearly thereafter for up 
      to 5 years. We utilized existing definitions of appropriate pharmacotherapy and 
      created definitions of potentially adequate psychotherapy/cognitive-behavioral 
      therapy (CBT). RESULTS: At intake, of 534 primary care participants with anxiety 
      disorders, 19% reported receiving appropriate pharmacotherapy and 14% potentially 
      adequate CBT. Overall, 28% of participants reported receiving potentially 
      adequate anxiety treatment, whether pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or both. Over 
      up to five years of follow-up, appropriate pharmacotherapy was received by 60% 
      and potentially adequate CBT by 36% of the sample. Examined together, 69% of 
      participants received any potentially adequate treatment during the follow-up 
      period. Over the course of follow-up, primary care patients with MDD, panic 
      disorder with agoraphobia, and with medicaid/medicare were more likely to receive 
      appropriate anxiety treatment. Ethnic minority members were less likely to 
      receive potentially adequate care. CONCLUSIONS: Potentially adequate anxiety 
      treatment was rarely received by primary care patients with anxiety disorders at 
      intake. Encouragingly, rates improved over the course of the study. However, 
      potentially adequate CBT remained much less utilized than pharmacotherapy and 
      racial-ethnic minority members were less likely to received care, suggesting much 
      room for improved dissemination of quality treatment.

TI  - Quality of and patient satisfaction with primary health care for anxiety 
      disorders.
PG  - 970-6
LID - 10.4088/JCP.09m05626blu [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most patients with anxiety disorders receive their care from primary 
      care practitioners (PCPs). The purpose of this study was to evaluate quality of 
      and patient satisfaction with primary health care for anxiety disorders. METHOD: 
      A survey was performed among 1,004 outpatients with anxiety disorders (diagnosed 
      according to DSM-IV) referred by their PCPs from 17 primary care clinical 
      settings (3 of which were university-affiliated) in 4 regions of the United 
      States for participation in the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management 
      (CALM) study, a therapeutic trial. Participating research institutions were the 
      University of Washington at Seattle, the University of California at San Diego 
      and Los Angeles, and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences at Little 
      Rock. Enrollment took place between June 2006 and April 2008. Patients were 
      contacted by telephone after enrollment to provide information about previous 
      care received (during the 6 months prior to referral) and satisfaction with that 
      care. Quality-of-care indicators were self-reported type, dose, and duration of 
      antianxiety medication treatment and self-reported psychotherapy with 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) elements. RESULTS: A total of 576 patients 
      (57.4%) had received an appropriate antianxiety medication in the previous 6 
      months, but only 289 patients (29.4% of 983 who answered this question) had 
      received the medication at adequate dose for at least 2 months. A total of 465 
      patients (46.3%) had received some counseling with at least 1 element of CBT, but 
      only 213 patients (21.2%) had received counseling with a strong (3+ elements) CBT 
      focus. Overall, 416 patients (41.4%) had received quality pharmacotherapy or 
      psychotherapy, and 81 patients (8.1%) had received both. Only 432 patients (44.8% 
      of 964 who answered this question) were at least somewhat satisfied with their 
      mental health care. Receipt of quality psychotherapy was the sole positive 
      predictor (adjusted odds ratio = 2.71; 95% CI, 1.94-3.80; P < .0005) of 
      satisfaction with mental health care for anxiety. Moreover, there was a 
      dose-response relationship between the number of CBT elements consistently 
      delivered and satisfaction with care (test for trend, z = 4.06, P < .0005). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Despite recognition of these patients' anxiety disorders and 
      referral by their PCPs to an anxiety treatment study, fewer than half of the 
      patients had in the prior 6 months received quality pharmacologic and/or 
      psychosocial mental health care. Receipt of CBT-oriented, quality psychosocial 
      (but not pharmacologic) care showed a strong dose-response relationship with 
      satisfaction with mental health care.

TI  - Child and Adolescent Adherence With Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Anxiety: 
      Predictors and Associations With Outcomes.
PG  - S215-S226
LID - 10.1080/15374416.2017.1310046 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders is effective, but 
      nonadherence with treatment may reduce the benefits of CBT. This study examined 
      (a) four baseline domains (i.e., demographic, youth clinical characteristics, 
      therapy related, family/parent factors) as predictors of youth adherence with 
      treatment and (b) the associations between youth adherence and treatment 
      outcomes. Data were from 279 youth (7-17 years of age, 51.6% female; 79.6% White, 
      9% African American), with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
      (4th ed., text rev.) diagnoses of separation anxiety disorder, generalized 
      anxiety disorder, and/or social phobia, who participated in CBT in the 
      Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study. Adherence was defined in three ways 
      (session attendance, therapist-rated compliance, and homework completion). 
      Multiple regressions revealed several significant predictors of youth adherence 
      with CBT, but predictors varied according to the definition of adherence. The 
      most robust predictors of greater adherence were living with both parents and 
      fewer youth comorbid externalizing disorders. With respect to outcomes, therapist 
      ratings of higher youth compliance with CBT predicted several indices of 
      favorable outcome: lower anxiety severity, higher global functioning, and 
      treatment responder status after 12 weeks of CBT. Number of sessions attended and 
      homework completion did not predict treatment outcomes. Findings provide 
      information about risks for youth nonadherence, which can inform treatment and 
      highlight the importance of youth compliance with participating in therapy 
      activities, rather than just attending sessions or completing homework 
      assignments.

TI  - One-session treatment compared with multisession CBT in children aged 7-16 years 
      with specific phobias: the ASPECT non-inferiority RCT.
PG  - 1-174
LID - 10.3310/IBCT0609 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Up to 10% of children and young people have a specific phobia that 
      can significantly affect their mental health, development and daily functioning. 
      Cognitive-behavioural therapy-based interventions remain the dominant treatment, 
      but limitations to their provision warrant investigation into low-intensity 
      alternatives. One-session treatment is one such alternative that shares 
      cognitive-behavioural therapy principles but has a shorter treatment period. 
      OBJECTIVE: This research investigated the non-inferiority of one-session 
      treatment to cognitive-behavioural therapy for treating specific phobias in 
      children and young people. The acceptability and cost-effectiveness of 
      one-session treatment were examined. DESIGN: A pragmatic, multicentre, 
      non-inferiority randomised controlled trial, with embedded economic and 
      qualitative evaluations. SETTINGS: There were 26 sites, including 12 NHS trusts. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Participants were aged 7-16 years and had a specific phobia defined 
      in accordance with established international clinical criteria. INTERVENTIONS: 
      Participants were randomised 1 : 1 to receive one-session treatment or usual-care 
      cognitive-behavioural therapy, and were stratified according to age and phobia 
      severity. Outcome assessors remained blind to treatment allocation. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the Behavioural Avoidance Task at 6 
      months' follow-up. Secondary outcomes included the Anxiety Disorder Interview 
      Schedule, Child Anxiety Impact Scale, Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression 
      Scale, a goal-based outcome measure, Child Health Utility 9D, EuroQol-5 
      Dimensions Youth version and resource usage. Treatment fidelity was assessed 
      using the Cognitive Behaviour Therapy Scale for Children and Young People and the 
      One-Session Treatment Rating Scale. RESULTS: A total of 274 participants were 
      recruited, with 268 participants randomised to one-session treatment (n = 134) or 
      cognitive-behavioural therapy (n = 134). A total of 197 participants contributed 
      some data, with 149 participants in the intention-to-treat analysis and 113 in 
      the per-protocol analysis. Mean Behavioural Avoidance Task scores at 6 months 
      were similar across treatment groups when both intention-to-treat and 
      per-protocol analyses were applied [cognitive-behavioural therapy: 7.1 (intention 
      to treat), 7.4 (per protocol); one-session treatment: 7.4 (intention to treat), 
      7.6 (per protocol); on the standardised scale adjusted mean difference for 
      cognitive-behavioural therapy compared with one-session treatment -0.123, 95% 
      confidence interval -0.449 to 0.202 (intention to treat), mean difference -0.204, 
      95% confidence interval -0.579 to 0.171 (per protocol)]. These findings were 
      wholly below the standardised non-inferiority limit of 0.4, which suggests that 
      one-session treatment is non-inferior to cognitive-behavioural therapy. No 
      between-group differences in secondary outcome measures were found. The health 
      economics evaluation suggested that, compared with cognitive-behavioural therapy, 
      one-session treatment marginally decreased the mean service use costs and 
      maintained similar mean quality-adjusted life-year improvement. Nested 
      qualitative evaluation found one-session treatment to be considered acceptable by 
      those who received it, their parents/guardians and clinicians. No adverse events 
      occurred as a result of phobia treatment. LIMITATIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic 
      meant that 48 children and young people could not complete the primary outcome 
      measure. Service waiting times resulted in some participants not starting therapy 
      before follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: One-session treatment for specific phobia in 
      UK-based child mental health treatment centres is as clinically effective as 
      multisession cognitive-behavioural therapy and highly likely to be cost-saving. 
      Future work could involve improving the implementation of one-session treatment 
      through training and commissioning of improved care pathways. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      This trial is registered as ISRCTN19883421. FUNDING: This project was funded by 
      the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Technology 
      Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health Technology 
      Assessment; Vol. 26, No. 42. See the NIHR Journals Library website for further

OAB - A phobia is an intense, ongoing fear of an everyday object or situation. The 
      phobia causes distress and the person with the phobia avoids that object or 
      situation. Many children and young people have phobias that affect their daily 
      lives. Cognitive–behavioural therapy helps by changing what people do or think 
      when they have a phobia and is the most common treatment approach. However, 
      cognitive–behavioural therapy is expensive, takes time and is not always easy to 
      get. Different treatments are needed to help children and young people with 
      specific phobias. One such therapy is one-session treatment, which works in 
      similar ways to cognitive–behavioural therapy but takes place over one main 
      3-hour session. Our study, called ASPECT (Alleviating Specific Phobias 
      Experienced by Children Trial), compared these two treatments to examine whether 
      or not one-session treatment is as effective as cognitive–behavioural therapy. 
      Overall, 274 children and young people aged 7–16 years from 26 sites nationally 
      helped with our research, of whom 268 received either cognitive–behavioural 
      therapy or one-session treatment. The results at 6 months found that one-session 
      treatment and cognitive–behavioural therapy worked as well as each other for 
      treating phobias in children and young people. We also found evidence that 
      one-session treatment is cheaper than cognitive–behavioural therapy. We spoke 
      with children and young people, their parents/guardians and the therapists of the 
      single-session treatment, and we found one-session treatment to be acceptable for 
      their needs. Future research could explore how to make one-session treatment more 
      easily available for children and young people with specific phobias because it 
      can save time and money, and works just as well as cognitive–behavioural therapy.

TI  - D-Cycloserine as an augmentation strategy with cognitive-behavioral therapy for 
      social anxiety disorder.
PG  - 751-8
LID - 10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.12070974 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors examined whether D-cycloserine, a partial agonist at the 
      glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, augments and accelerates a full 
      course of comprehensive cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in adults with 
      generalized social anxiety disorder. METHOD: This was a multisite randomized 
      placebo-controlled efficacy study with 169 medication-free adults with 
      generalized social anxiety disorder, of whom 144 completed the 12-week treatment 
      and 131 completed the three follow-up assessments. Patients were randomly 
      assigned to receive 50 mg of D-cycloserine or placebo 1 hour before each of five 
      exposure sessions that were part of a 12-session cognitive-behavioral group 
      treatment. Response and remission status was determined at baseline, throughout 
      treatment, at end of treatment, and at 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up assessments 
      by assessors who were blind to treatment condition. RESULTS: 
      D-Cycloserine-augmented and placebo-augmented CBT were associated with similar 
      completion rates (87% and 82%), response rates (79.3% and 73.3%), and remission 
      rates (34.5% and 24.4%) at the posttreatment assessment; response and remission 
      rates were largely maintained at the follow-up assessments. Although 
      D-cycloserine was associated with a 24%-33% faster rate of improvement in symptom 
      severity and remission rates relative to placebo during the treatment phase, the 
      groups did not differ in response and remission rates. CONCLUSIONS: D-Cycloserine 
      did not augment a full course of comprehensive CBT for social anxiety disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) commonly 
      co-occur in individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD), yet whether these 
      comorbidities influence the outcomes of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for 
      SAD is unclear. METHODS: The present study examined the degree to which 
      individuals with SAD and comorbid MDD (SAD+MDD; n=76), comorbid BD (SAD+BD; 
      n=19), a comorbid anxiety disorder (SAD+ANX; n=27), or no comorbid diagnoses 
      (SAD+NCO; n=41) benefitted from CBT for SAD. Individuals were screened using the 
      Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and then completed the Social Phobia 
      Inventory and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales before and after 12-weeks of 
      group CBT for SAD. RESULTS: At pretreatment the SAD+MDD and SAD+BD groups 
      reported higher social anxiety symptoms than the SAD+ANX and SAD+NCO groups. All 
      groups reported large and significant improvement in social anxiety with CBT. 
      However, at posttreatment the SAD+MDD and SAD+BD groups continued to have higher 
      social anxiety symptoms than the SAD+NCO group, and the SAD+ANX group did not 
      differ in social anxiety symptoms from any group. The sample also showed small 
      and statistically significant improvement in depressive symptoms with CBT for 
      SAD. LIMITATIONS: Information about medication was not collected in the present 
      study, and we did not assess the long-term effects of CBT. CONCLUSION: Our 
      results suggest that CBT for SAD is an effective treatment even in the presence 
      of comorbid mood disorders in the short-term, although extending the course of 
      treatment may be helpful for this population and should be investigated in future 
      research.

TI  - Benefits of child-focused anxiety treatments for parents and family functioning.
PG  - 865-72
LID - 10.1002/da.22055 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To examine (1) changes in parent (global psychological distress, 
      trait anxiety) and family (dysfunction, burden) functioning following 12 weeks of 
      child-focused anxiety treatment, and (2) whether changes in these parent and 
      family factors were associated with child's treatment condition and response. 
      METHODS: Participants were 488 youth ages 7-17 years (50% female; mean age 10.7 
      years) who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for social phobia, separation anxiety, and/or 
      generalized anxiety disorder, and their parents. Youth were randomly assigned to 
      12 weeks of "Coping Cat" individual cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), 
      medication management with sertraline (SRT), their combination (COMB), or 
      medication management with pill placebo (PBO) within the multisite 
      Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS). At pre- and posttreatment, 
      parents completed measures of trait anxiety, psychological distress, family 
      functioning, and burden of child illness; children completed a measure of family 
      functioning. Blinded independent evaluators rated child's response to treatment 
      using the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale at posttreatment. RESULTS: 
      Analyses of covariance revealed that parental psychological distress and trait 
      anxiety, and parent-reported family dysfunction improved only for parents of 
      children who were rated as treatment responders, and these changes were unrelated 
      to treatment condition. Family burden and child-reported family dysfunction 
      improved significantly from pre- to posttreatment regardless of treatment 
      condition or response. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that child-focused anxiety 
      treatments, regardless of intervention condition, can result in improvements in 
      nontargeted parent symptoms and family functioning particularly when children 
      respond successfully to the treatment.

LID - S1386-5056(20)30042-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104171 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a well-established treatment 
      for panic disorder, but many fewer patients receive this treatment compared to 
      medication-based therapy. Mobile app-based interactive CBT using a chatbot can 
      increase patient access to CBT. We performed a preliminary study to determine 
      whether short-term use of a newly developed chatbot is feasible and effective for 
      relieving panic symptoms. METHOD: Forty-one patients were randomly assigned to 
      either a chatbot group (n = 21) or control group (n = 20) for a period of 4 
      weeks. The chatbot group was guided in the use of the chatbot application, while 
      the control group was provided with a book on panic disorder. MAIN RESULTS: The 
      severity of panic disorder was significantly decreased in the chatbot group, but 
      not in the control group. The social phobia score was significantly decreased and 
      the control helplessness score was significantly increased in the chatbot group 
      compared to the control group. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We found that mobile 
      app-based interactive CBT using the chatbot was feasible and effective for 
      reducing the severity of panic symptoms. Using this novel approach to provide CBT 
      would allow clinicians to effect positive therapeutic outcomes with easy 
      accessibility, interactivity, and self-management for patients with panic 
      symptoms.

TI  - Neural substrates of treatment response to cognitive-behavioral therapy in panic 
      disorder with agoraphobia.
PG  - 1345-55
LID - 10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.12111484 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an 
      effective treatment option for panic disorder with agoraphobia, the neural 
      substrates of treatment response remain unknown. Evidence suggests that panic 
      disorder with agoraphobia is characterized by dysfunctional safety signal 
      processing. Using fear conditioning as a neurofunctional probe, the authors 
      investigated neural baseline characteristics and neuroplastic changes after CBT 
      that were associated with treatment outcome in patients with panic disorder with 
      agoraphobia. METHOD: Neural correlates of fear conditioning and extinction were 
      measured using functional MRI before and after a manualized CBT program focusing 
      on behavioral exposure in 49 medication-free patients with a primary diagnosis of 
      panic disorder with agoraphobia. Treatment response was defined as a reduction 
      exceeding 50% in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores. RESULTS: At baseline, 
      nonresponders exhibited enhanced activation in the right pregenual anterior 
      cingulate cortex, the hippocampus, and the amygdala in response to a safety 
      signal. While this activation pattern partly resolved in nonresponders after CBT, 
      successful treatment was characterized by increased right hippocampal activation 
      when processing stimulus contingencies. Treatment response was associated with an 
      inhibitory functional coupling between the anterior cingulate cortex and the 
      amygdala that did not change over time. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified brain 
      activation patterns associated with treatment response in patients with panic 
      disorder with agoraphobia. Altered safety signal processing and anterior 
      cingulate cortex-amygdala coupling may indicate individual differences among 
      these patients that determine the effectiveness of exposure-based CBT and 
      associated neuroplastic changes. Findings point to brain networks by which 
      successful CBT in this patient population is mediated.

TI  - Group cognitive behavioural therapy with virtual reality exposure versus group 
      cognitive behavioural therapy with in vivo exposure for social anxiety disorder 
      and agoraphobia: a protocol for a randomised clinical trial.
PG  - e051147
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-051147 [doi]
LID - e051147
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anxiety disorders have a high lifetime prevalence, early-onset and 
      long duration or chronicity. Exposure therapy is considered one of the most 
      effective elements in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for anxiety, but in 
      vivo exposure can be challenging to access and control, and is sometimes rejected 
      by patients because they consider it too aversive. Virtual reality allows 
      flexible and controlled exposure to challenging situations in an immersive and 
      protected environment. AIM: The SoREAL-trial aims to investigate the effect of 
      group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT-in vivo) versus group CBT with virtual 
      reality exposure (CBT-in virtuo) for patients diagnosed with social anxiety 
      disorder and/or agoraphobia, in mixed groups. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The design is 
      an investigator-initiated randomised, assessor-blinded, parallel-group and 
      superiority-designed clinical trial. Three hundred two patients diagnosed with 
      social anxiety disorder and/or agoraphobia will be included from the regional 
      mental health centres of Copenhagen and North Sealand and the Northern Region of 
      Denmark. All patients will be offered a manual-based 14-week cognitive 
      behavioural group treatment programme, including eight sessions with exposure 
      therapy. Therapy groups will be centrally randomised with concealed allocation 
      sequence to either CBT-in virtuo or CBT-in vivo. Patients will be assessed at 
      baseline, post-treatment and 1-year follow-up by treatment blinded researchers 
      and research assistants. The primary outcome will be diagnosis-specific symptoms 
      measured with the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale for patients with social anxiety 
      disorder and the Mobility Inventory for Agoraphobia for patients with 
      agoraphobia. Secondary outcome measures will include depression symptoms, social 
      functioning and patient satisfaction. Exploratory outcomes will be substance and 
      alcohol use, working alliance and quality of life. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The 
      trial has been approved by the research ethics committee in the Capital Region of 
      Denmark. All results, positive, negative as well as inconclusive, will be 
      published as quickly as possible and still in concordance with Danish law on the 
      protection of confidentially and personal information. Results will be presented 
      at national and international scientific conferences. The trial has obtained 
      approval by the Regional Ethics Committee of Zealand (H-6-2013-015) and the 
      Danish Data Protection Agency (RHP-2014-009-02670). The trial is registered at 
      ClinicalTrial.gov as NCT03845101. The patients will receive information on the 
      trial both verbally and in written form. Written informed consent will be 
      obtained from each patient before inclusion in the trial. The consent form will 
      be scanned and stored in the database system and the physical copy will be 
      destroyed. It is emphasised that participation in the trial is voluntary and that 
      the patient can withdraw his or her consent at any time without consequences for 
      further and continued treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03845101.

TI  - Anxiety disorders: treatable regardless of the severity of comorbid alcohol 
      dependence.
PG  - 109-15
AB  - AIMS: Clinical and epidemiological research has shown that comorbidity is the 
      rule rather than exception in the case of psychiatric disorders. Cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT) has been clearly demonstrated to be effective in 
      treating anxiety and avoidance symptoms in patient samples of social phobia and 
      agoraphobia without comorbid alcohol use disorders. It has recently been shown 
      that treatment of comorbid anxiety disorders in alcohol-dependent patients can 
      also be very successful. The purpose of the present study was to find predictors 
      of treatment success for comorbid anxiety disorders in alcohol-dependent 
      patients. METHODS: The study was conducted in a sample of 34 completers with a 
      double diagnosis of alcohol dependence and agoraphobia or social phobia who 
      received CBT for their comorbid anxiety disorder in a 32-week randomized 
      controlled trial comparing alcohol and CBT anxiety disorder treatment with 
      alcohol treatment alone. In the current report, treatment success was defined as 
      a clinically significant change (recovery) on the anxiety discomfort scale. 
      RESULTS: The severity of comorbid alcohol dependence did not influence the 
      beneficial effect of CBT on the anxiety disorder. Psychological distress 
      (SCL-90), neuroticism (NEO N), conscientiousness (NEO C), gender, employment and 
      age of onset of alcohol dependence showed some predictive value. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Alcohol-dependent males with a comorbid anxiety disorder seem to benefit most 
      from CBT if their alcohol dependence started after age 25, if they are employed 
      and if their general psychopathology is less severe. The most important 
      conclusion, however, is that even severely alcohol-dependent patients with an 
      anxiety disorder can benefit from psychotherapy for their anxiety disorder.

LID - 10.1186/1753-2000-4-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the design, methods, and rationale of the Child/Adolescent 
      Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS), a recently completed federally-funded, 
      multi-site, randomized placebo-controlled trial that examined the relative 
      efficacy of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT), sertraline (SRT), and their 
      combination (COMB) against pill placebo (PBO) for the treatment of separation 
      anxiety disorder (SAD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and social phobia 
      (SoP) in children and adolescents. METHODS: Following a brief review of the acute 
      outcomes of the CAMS trial, as well as the psychosocial and pharmacologic 
      treatment literature for pediatric anxiety disorders, the design and methods of 
      the CAMS trial are described. RESULTS: CAMS was a six-year, six-site, randomized 
      controlled trial. Four hundred eighty-eight (N = 488) children and adolescents 
      (ages 7-17 years) with DSM-IV-TR diagnoses of SAD, GAD, or SoP were randomly 
      assigned to one of four treatment conditions: CBT, SRT, COMB, or PBO. Assessments 
      of anxiety symptoms, safety, and functional outcomes, as well as putative 
      mediators and moderators of treatment response were completed in a multi-measure, 
      multi-informant fashion. Manual-based therapies, trained clinicians and 
      independent evaluators were used to ensure treatment and assessment fidelity. A 
      multi-layered administrative structure with representation from all sites 
      facilitated cross-site coordination of the entire trial, study protocols and 
      quality assurance. CONCLUSIONS: CAMS offers a model for clinical trials methods 
      applicable to psychosocial and psychopharmacological comparative treatment trials 
      by using state-of-the-art methods and rigorous cross-site quality controls. CAMS 
      also provided a large-scale examination of the relative and combined efficacy and 
      safety of the best evidenced-based psychosocial (CBT) and pharmacologic (SSRI) 
      treatments to date for the most commonly occurring pediatric anxiety disorders. 
      Primary and secondary results of CAMS will hold important implications for 
      informing practice-relevant decisions regarding the initial treatment of youth 
      with anxiety disorders. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00052078.

TI  - The treatment of social anxiety disorder.
PG  - 883-908
AB  - We review the available treatments for social anxiety disorder, focusing 
      primarily on psychotherapeutic interventions for adults, but also giving briefer 
      summaries of pharmacological treatments and treatments for children and 
      adolescents. The most well-researched psychosocial treatments for social anxiety 
      disorder are cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBTs), and meta-analyses indicate 
      that all forms of CBT appear likely to provide some benefit for adults. In 
      addition, there are several pharmacological treatments with demonstrated 
      efficacy, and cognitive-behavioral interventions have some demonstrated efficacy 
      for children and adolescents. We outline a number of concerns regarding this 
      literature, including the questions of what influences treatment response and 
      what role combinations of CBT and medication might have. Clearly, although a 
      number of treatments appear well-established in regard to their effects on social 
      anxiety disorder, a number of opportunities for future research remain, including 
      the search for predictors of who will benefit from which treatment.

AB  - Although clinical intuitions influence psychotherapeutic practice and are a rich 
      source of novel hypotheses for research, many remain to be empirically tested. 
      This study evaluates whether clinicians' beliefs about barriers to progress in 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for panic disorder are supported by data. Data 
      from a randomized-controlled trial comparing CBT to panic-focused psychodynamic 
      psychotherapy (PFPP) for adults with primary panic disorder (N = 161) were used 
      to evaluate 15 factors endorsed by clinicians as impediments to CBT in a recent 
      survey. Panic severity was assessed before, during (at Weeks 1, 5, and 9), and at 
      termination of treatment (Week 12) using the Panic Disorder Severity Scale. 
      Hierarchical linear modeling revealed that none of the perceived barriers were 
      predictive of poor outcome. Contrary to clinicians' intuitions, dissociation 
      during panic attacks was associated with greater symptomatic improvement in both 
      treatment arms (β = -0.69, p < .05), above the effect of established predictors. 
      Moderation analyses revealed that when patients had PTSD diagnosed with the 
      Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (β = 1.71, p < .05) or less severe panic 
      disorder (β = 0.45, p = .04), they changed more rapidly in CBT than in PFPP. 
      Overall, clinician agreement was inversely related to the strength of a predictor 
      (r = -.24, p = .39). Although clinical intuitions can be useful as clinical and 
      empirical signals, such beliefs should be critically examined before informing 
      practice. Dialogue between academics and clinicians might be enhanced through 
      research that incorporates input from front-line practitioners.

      therapy in social anxiety disorder.
PG  - 1114-1122
LID - 10.1002/da.22540 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine the cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy 
      (CBT) versus psychodynamic therapy (PDT) in the treatment of social anxiety 
      disorder after a follow-up of 30 months from a societal perspective. METHODS: 
      This analysis was conducted alongside the multicenter SOPHO-NET trial; adults 
      with a primary diagnosis of social anxiety disorder received CBT (n = 209) or PDT 
      (n = 207). Data on health care utilization and productivity loss were collected 
      at baseline, after 6 months (posttreatment), and three further follow-ups to 
      calculate direct and indirect costs. Anxiety-free days (AFDs) calculated based on 
      remission and response were used as measure of effect. The incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was determined. Net benefit regressions, adjusted 
      for comorbidities and baseline differences, were applied to derive 
      cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: In the descriptive analysis, 
      the unadjusted ICER favored CBT over PDT and the adjusted analysis showed that 
      CBT's cost-effectiveness relative to PDT depends on the willingness to pay (WTP) 
      per AFD. As baseline costs differed substantially the unadjusted estimates might 
      be deceptive. If additional WTPs for CBT of €0, €10, and €30 were assumed, the 
      probability of CBT being cost-effective relative to PDT was 65, 83, and 96%. 
      Direct costs increased compared to baseline across groups, whereas indirect costs 
      did not change significantly. Results were sensitive to considered costs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: If the society is willing to pay ≥€30 per additional AFD, CBT can be 
      considered cost-effective, relative to PDT, with certainty. To further increase 
      the cost-effectiveness more knowledge regarding predictors of treatment outcome 
      seems essential.

TI  - Predictors and moderators of treatment dropout in cognitive-behavioral and 
      psychodynamic therapies for panic disorder.
PG  - 432-442
LID - 10.1080/10503307.2020.1784487 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Panic disorder patients who drop out of treatment typically do not 
      remit from their disorder. How patient-level moderators influence dropping out of 
      one panic-focused treatment over another has never been examined, nor in non-CBT 
      treatments. Method: 200 patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia 
      were randomized to receive cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), panic-focused 
      psychodynamic psychotherapy (PFPP), or applied relaxation training (ART) across 
      two sites. Therapy was twice a week for 12 weeks. A two-step variable search 
      method was applied to identify potential prognostic predictors and moderators of 
      patient dropout. Survival models predicting hazard of session-by-session dropout 
      tested the resulting variables. Results: Across treatments, unemployment and 
      higher psychosocial disability on the Sheehan Disability Scale predicted 
      increased risk of dropout, while patients with higher anxiety sensitivity were 
      more likely to complete treatment. Patients who reported experiencing childhood 
      abuse had heightened dropout in ART, but not CBT or PFPP. Men were especially 
      likely to complete PFPP. Session 2 expectancies and patient-rated alliance 
      predicted lower dropout only in CBT. Conclusions: Patient-level factors may 
      influence both whether patients will complete any treatment, and whether they 
      continue in a particular panic-focused therapy. Moderators of dropout (e.g., 
      abuse history) may inform treatment decisions for specific patients.Trial

TI  - Implementing panic-focused psychodynamic psychotherapy into clinical practice.
PG  - 326-34
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of manualized panic-focused 
      psychodynamic psychotherapy (PFPP) in routine care in Germany. METHOD: German 
      psychoanalysts were trained according to the PFPP manual. Fifty-four consecutive 
      outpatients with panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) were randomly 
      assigned in a 2:1 ratio to PFPP or cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) plus 
      exposure therapy. Subjects (female 57.4%; mean age 36.2 years) had high rates of 
      psychiatric (68.5%) and somatic (64.8%) comorbidity, and previous psychiatric 
      treatments (57.4%). Assessments were performed pre- and posttreatment and at 
      6-month follow-up. The primary outcome measure was the Panic Disorder Severity 
      Scale. RESULTS: Both treatments were highly effective. In patients randomized to 
      PFPP, remission was achieved in 44.4% at termination and by 50% at follow-up (CBT 
      61.1% and 55.6%, respectively). No significant differences were found. Emotional 
      awareness, a posited moderator of good outcome in psychotherapies, was 
      significantly higher in the CBT group at baseline. It was found to be a strong 
      moderator of treatment effectiveness in both treatments. After adjusting for 
      initial Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS) scores, effect sizes (ESs) for 
      the primary outcome were Cohen d = 1.28, from pre- to posttreatment, and d = 
      1.03, from pretreatment to follow-up, for PFPP, and d = 1.81 and 1.28 for CBT, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PFPP was implemented effectively into clinical 
      practice by psychoanalysts in the community in a sample with severe mental 
      illness with large ESs. Assessment of LEAS may facilitate the identification of 
      patients suitable for short-term psychotherapy. ( CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION

TI  - The Role of Social Skills in Predicting Treatment-Recovery in Children with a 
      Social Anxiety Disorder.
PG  - 1461-1472
LID - 10.1007/s10802-021-00824-x [doi]
AB  - The current study investigated the role of social skills and its interaction with 
      social anxiety as predictors of treatment outcome in children with an anxiety 
      disorder either with or without a social anxiety disorder (SoAD). In total, 133 
      children (aged 8 to 13) with an anxiety disorder received a 10-session cognitive 
      behavioral treatment (FRIENDS program). Pre- to post treatment Reliable Change 
      (RC) and Treatment-Recovery (TR) were assessed from a multi-informant 
      perspective, by including diagnostic information (ADIS C/P), child-reported 
      anxiety symptoms (MASC) and parent-reported internalizing symptoms (CBCL-Int). 
      Social skills were assessed with the parent-rated Social Skills Rating System 
      (assertion, self-control, responsibility). Results showed that 1) parents of 
      children with a SoAD reported significantly less favorable use of assertive and 
      responsible social behavior in their children pre-treatment than parents of 
      children without SoAD, 2) children with higher social skills had a better 
      treatment recovery, and 3) children with anxiety and higher responsible behavior 
      pre-treatment and without a SoAD had a better treatment recovery, but this effect 
      did not show for children with SoAD. In conclusion, better use of social behavior 
      increased the likelihood of treatment recovery but not of reliable change. 
      Further studies on the role of social skills in the treatment of childhood 
      (social) anxiety are needed to investigate the mechanisms by which social skills 
      impact treatment outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Existing literature on panic disorder (PD) yields no data regarding 
      the differential rates of improvement during Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), 
      Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) or both combined (CBT+SSRI). 
      METHOD: Patients were randomized to CBT, SSRI or CBT+SSRI which each lasted one 
      year including three months of medication taper. Participating patients kept 
      record of the frequency of panic attacks throughout the full year of treatment. 
      Rate of improvement on panic frequency and the relationship between rate of 
      improvement and baseline agoraphobia (AG) were examined. RESULTS: A significant 
      decline in frequency of panic attacks was observed for each treatment modality. 
      SSRI and CBT+SSRI were associated with a significant faster rate of improvement 
      as compared to CBT. Gains were maintained after tapering medication. For patients 
      with moderate or severe AG, CBT+SSRI was associated with a more rapid improvement 
      on panic frequency as compared to patients receiving either mono-treatment. 
      LIMITATIONS: Frequency of panic attacks was not assessed beyond the full year of 
      treatment. Second, only one process variable was used. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with 
      PD respond well to each treatment as indicated by a significant decline in panic 
      attacks. CBT is associated with a slower rate of improvement as compared to SSRI 
      and CBT+SSRI. Discontinuation of SSRI treatment does not result in a revival of 
      frequency of panic attacks. Our data suggest that for patients without or with 
      only mild AG, SSRI-only will suffice. For patients with moderate or severe AG, 
      the combined CBT+SSRI treatment is recommended.

TI  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy with gay, lesbian, and bisexual clients.
PG  - 629-43
AB  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be adapted to a wide range of clinical 
      difficulties and presenting problems that face lesbians, gay men, and bisexual 
      persons. The following article presents general guidelines for and two case 
      examples of the use of CBT. The first case is a gay male struggling with social 
      phobia. This case is an example of how to adapt a structured, empirically 
      supported cognitive-behavioral treatment focusing on social phobia to situations 
      that are associated with his sexual orientation. The second is a woman struggling 
      with multiple issues including coming out. This case provides an example of how 
      to add specific cognitive-behavioral techniques to coming-out issues within the 
      context of a more eclectic, longer-term therapy.

TI  - HPA AXIS RELATED GENES AND RESPONSE TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPIES: GENETICS AND 
      EPIGENETICS.
PG  - 861-70
LID - 10.1002/da.22430 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning has been 
      implicated in the development of stress-related psychiatric diagnoses and 
      response to adverse life experiences. This study aimed to investigate the 
      association between genetic and epigenetics in HPA axis and response to cognitive 
      behavior therapy (CBT). METHODS: Children with anxiety disorders were recruited 
      into the Genes for Treatment project (GxT, N = 1,152). Polymorphisms of FKBP5 and 
      GR were analyzed for association with response to CBT. Percentage DNA methylation 
      at the FKBP5 and GR promoter regions was measured before and after CBT in a 
      subset (n = 98). Linear mixed effect models were used to investigate the 
      relationship between genotype, DNA methylation, and change in primary anxiety 
      disorder severity (treatment response). RESULTS: Treatment response was not 
      associated with FKBP5 and GR polymorphisms, or pretreatment percentage DNA 
      methylation. However, change in FKBP5 DNA methylation was nominally significantly 
      associated with treatment response. Participants who demonstrated the greatest 
      reduction in severity decreased in percentage DNA methylation during treatment, 
      whereas those with little/no reduction in severity increased in percentage DNA 
      methylation. This effect was driven by those with one or more FKBP5 risk alleles, 
      with no association seen in those with no FKBP5 risk alleles. No significant 
      association was found between GR methylation and response. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Allele-specific change in FKBP5 methylation was associated with treatment 
      response. This is the largest study to date investigating the role of HPA axis 
      related genes in response to a psychological therapy. Furthermore, this is the 
      first study to demonstrate that DNA methylation changes may be associated with 
      response to psychological therapies in a genotype-dependent manner.

PG  - 451-463
LID - 10.1177/1359104520981401 [doi]
AB  - Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is a feeding and eating 
      disorder that results in nutritional inadequacies, weight loss, and/or dependence 
      on enteral feeds, and for which three clinical subtypes have been described. We 
      present a unique case of an 11-year-old boy with rigid ARFID since infancy and 
      features of all three ARFID subtypes. The patient presented with a life-long 
      history of sensory aversion, limited intake and phobia of vomiting resulting in 
      restriction to a single food item (yogurt) for more than 5 years. He presented 
      with severe iron-deficiency anaemia, and deficiencies of vitamins A, C, D, E and 
      zinc. We employed a multimodal therapeutic approach that incorporated elements of 
      cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), family-based therapy (FBT) and 
      pharmacological management with an antidepressant medication (sertraline) and an 
      atypical antipsychotic agent (olanzapine). Over the course of a 7-week admission, 
      our approach assisted the patient in successful weight restoration and 
      incorporation of at least three new food items into his daily diet. While there 
      are currently no first-line recommendations for ARFID management, our study lends 
      support to the efficacy of CBT, FBT and pharmacological management for ARFID 
      patients, including complex cases with multiple subtype features. Further 
      research is needed to strengthen ARFID clinical guidelines.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Correct prediction of treatment response is a central goal of 
      precision psychiatry. Here, we tested the predictive accuracy of a variety of 
      pre-treatment patient characteristics, including clinical, demographic, molecular 
      genetic, and neuroimaging markers, for treatment response in patients with social 
      anxiety disorder (SAD). METHODS: Forty-seven SAD patients (mean±SD age 33.9 ± 9.4 
      years, 24 women) were randomized and commenced 9 weeks' Internet-delivered 
      cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) combined either with the selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram (20 mg daily [10 mg first week], SSRI+CBT, 
      n = 24) or placebo (placebo+CBT, n = 23). Treatment responders were defined from 
      the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I ≤ 2). Before treatment, 
      patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging and the Multi-Source 
      Interference Task taxing cognitive interference. Support vector machines (SVMs) 
      were trained to separate responders from nonresponders based on pre-treatment 
      neural reactivity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), amygdala, and 
      occipital cortex, as well as molecular genetic, demographic, and clinical data. 
      SVM models were tested using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. RESULTS: The 
      best model separated treatment responders (n = 24) from nonresponders based on 
      pre-treatment dACC reactivity (83% accuracy, P = 0.001). Responders had greater 
      pre-treatment dACC reactivity than nonresponders especially in the SSRI+CBT 
      group. No other variable was associated with clinical response or added 
      predictive accuracy to the dACC SVM model. LIMITATIONS: Small sample size, 
      especially for genetic analyses. No replication or validation samples were 
      available. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate that treatment outcome 
      predictions based on neural cingulate activity, at the individual level, 
      outperform genetic, demographic, and clinical variables for medication-assisted 
      Internet-delivered CBT, supporting the use of neuroimaging in precision 
      psychiatry.

TI  - Manualized Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment of Social Anxiety Disorder: A Case 
      Study.
PG  - 35-47
AB  - Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, is one of the most 
      common anxiety disorders and has been shown to be effectively treated using 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Recently, a manualized CBT treatment for SAD 
      has been developed (Hope, Heimberg, & Turk, 2006), with research demonstrating 
      superior treatment outcomes with CBT relative to alternatives (e.g., psychotropic 
      medication). The current case study of Henry, a 26-year old Caucasian male with 
      SAD, implemented this manualized CBT for SAD. Treatment consisted of 15 
      individual sessions, with follow-ups occurring 2 and 8 months post-treatment. 
      Henry showed marked reductions in SAD symptoms throughout the course of 
      treatment, resulting in complete remission of SAD at the end of formal treatment. 
      His SAD continued to be in remission at the 2-and 8-month follow-up sessions. 
      This case study demonstrates the usefulness of a manualized, individual CBT 
      treatment for SAD.

AB  - There is evidence for non-specific factors impacting treatment outcomes, with 
      pragmatic concerns regarding the need to popularize briefer formats of cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT). The need to have more culturally suitable and 
      acceptable forms of CBT is also indicated. We evaluated the feasibility and 
      efficacy of a brief 5 session CBT (bCBT) in participants (N = 4) with panic 
      disorder (PD) and agoraphobia, using a non-concurrent multiple baseline design. 
      In this case series, efforts were made to maximize non-specific factors of 
      psychotherapy in bringing about treatment outcomes. Reliable and significant 
      treatment effects were observed at post-intervention and follow-up assessments. 
      The present study offers preliminary evidence of a bCBT protocol that comprises 
      the efforts to maximize the non-specific factors in psychotherapy such as 
      credibility, expectancy, and the therapeutic alliance in bringing treatment 
      outcomes; however, further controlled evaluation is warranted. We also discuss 
      the mechanisms contributing to these treatment outcomes in the present protocol.

TI  - Virtual reality-based cognitive behavioural therapy for patients with generalized 
      social anxiety disorder: a pilot study.
PG  - 745-750
LID - 10.1017/S1352465819000225 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with generalized social anxiety disorder (SAD) avoid various 
      social situations and can be reluctant to engage in in vivo exposure therapy. 
      Highly personalized practising can be required before patients are ready to 
      perform in vivo exposure. Virtual reality-based therapy could be beneficial for 
      this group. AIMS: To assess the feasibility and potential effect of virtual 
      reality-based cognitive behavioural therapy (VR-CBT) for patients with severe 
      generalized SAD. METHODS: Fifteen patients with generalized SAD attended up to 16 
      VR-CBT sessions. Questionnaires on clinical and functional outcomes, and diary 
      assessments on social activity, social anxiety and paranoia were completed at 
      baseline, post-treatment and at 6-months follow-up. RESULTS: Two patients dropped 
      out of treatment. Improvements in social anxiety and quality of life were found 
      at post-treatment. At follow-up, depressive symptoms had decreased, and the 
      effect on social anxiety was maintained. With respect to diary assessments, 
      social anxiety in company and paranoia were significantly reduced by 
      post-treatment. These improvements were maintained at follow-up. No increase was 
      observed in social activity. CONCLUSIONS: This uncontrolled pilot study 
      demonstrates the feasibility and treatment potential of VR-CBT in a 
      difficult-to-treat group of patients with generalized SAD. Results suggest that 
      VR-CBT may be effective in reducing anxiety as well as depression, and can 
      increase quality of life.

TI  - The outcome of children with selective mutism following cognitive behavioral 
      intervention: a follow-up study.
PG  - 481-7
LID - 10.1007/s00431-015-2651-0 [doi]
AB  - Selective mutism (SM) is a relatively rare childhood disorder and is 
      underdiagnosed and undertreated. The purpose of the retrospective naturalistic 
      study was to examine the long-term outcome of children with SM who were treated 
      with specifically designed modular cognitive behavioral therapy (MCBT). Parents 
      of 36 children who met diagnostic criteria of SM that received MCBT treatment 
      were invited for a follow-up evaluation. Parents were interviewed using 
      structured scales and completed questionnaires regarding the child, including the 
      Selective Mutism Questionnaire (SMQ). Twenty-four subjects were identified and 
      evaluated. Their mean age ± SD of onset of SM symptoms, beginning of treatment, 
      and age at follow-up were 3.4 ± 1.4, 6.4 ± 3.1, and 9.3 ± 3.4 years, 
      respectively. There was robust improvement from beginning of treatment to 
      follow-up evaluation in SM, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobia 
      symptoms. The recovery rate from SM was 84.2 %. CONCLUSION: SM-focused MCBT is 
      feasible in children and possibly effective in inducing long-term reduction of SM 
      and comorbid anxiety symptoms. WHAT IS KNOWN: • There are limited empirical data 
      on selective mutism (SM) treatment outcome and specifically on 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy, with the majority of studies being uncontrolled 
      case reports of 1 to 2 cases each. • There is also limited data on the long-term 
      outcome of children with SM following treatment. What is New: • Modular cognitive 
      behavioral treatment is a feasible and possibly effective treatment for SM. 
      Intervention at a younger age is more effective comparing to an older age. • 
      Treatment for SM also decreases the rate of psychiatric comorbidities, including 
      separation anxiety disorder and specific phobia.

TI  - Short-term cost-effectiveness of psychodynamic therapy and cognitive-behavioral

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the short-term cost-effectiveness of 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and psychodynamic therapy (PDT) compared to 
      waiting list (WL). METHODS: The analysis was conducted alongside the SOPHO-NET 
      multi-center efficacy trial. Patients were randomly assigned to CBT (n=209), PDT 
      (n=207), or WL (n=79). Resource use was assessed prior and during treatment to 
      determine direct and absenteeism costs. Unadjusted incremental cost-effectiveness 
      ratios (ICERs) were calculated based on remission and response rates. To 
      visualize statistical uncertainty, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves 
      (CEACs) were constructed based on adjusted net-benefit regression. Different 
      values for the society׳s willingness to pay (WTP) were assumed. RESULTS: Both 
      interventions were more efficacious than WL but were associated with increased 
      direct costs besides intervention costs. Unadjusted ICERs per responder were 
      €3615 for CBT and €4958 for PDT. Unadjusted ICERs per remitted patient were €5788 
      and €10,733. CEACs revealed a high degree of uncertainty: applying the 97.5% 
      probability threshold, CBT proved cost-effective at a WTP ≥€16,100 per responder 
      and ≥€26,605 per remitted patient. Regarding PDT cost-effectiveness only was 
      certain for response at a WTP ≥€27,290. LIMITATIONS: The WL condition is assumed 
      to represent untreated patients, although the expectation to start treatment in 
      the near future probably affects symptom severity and health care utilization. 
      CONCLUSIONS: At the end of treatment cost-effectiveness of CBT and PDT compared 
      to WL is uncertain and depends on the societal WTP. The interventions may induce 
      a more adequate utilization of other health care services - involving increased 
      costs. Development of costs and effects in the long-run should be considered.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine optimal Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) percent 
      reduction and raw score cut-offs for predicting treatment response and remission 
      among children and adolescents with anxiety disorders. METHOD: Data were from a 
      subset of youth (N = 438; 7-17 years of age) who participated in the 
      Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS), a multi-site, randomized 
      controlled trial that examined the relative efficacy of cognitive-behavioral 
      therapy (CBT; Coping Cat), medication (sertraline [SRT]), their combination, and 
      pill placebo for the treatment of separation anxiety disorder, generalized 
      anxiety disorder, and social phobia. The clinician-rated PARS was administered 
      pre- and posttreatment (delivered over 12 weeks). Quality receiver operating 
      characteristic methods assessed the performance of various PARS percent 
      reductions and absolute cut-off scores in predicting treatment response and 
      remission, as determined by posttreatment ratings on the Clinical Global 
      Impression scales and the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV. 
      Corresponding change in impairment was evaluated using the Child Anxiety Impact 
      Scale. RESULTS: Reductions of 35% and 50% on the six-item PARS optimally 
      predicted treatment response and remission, respectively. Post-treatment PARS raw 
      scores of 8 to 10 optimally predicted remission. Anxiety improved as a function 
      of PARS-defined treatment response and remission. CONCLUSIONS: Results serve as 
      guidelines for operationalizing treatment response and remission in future 
      research and in making cross-study comparisons. These guidelines can facilitate 
      translation of research findings into clinical practice.

TI  - DNA methylation of FKBP5 and response to exposure-based psychological therapy.
PG  - 150-158
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.32650 [doi]
AB  - Differential DNA methylation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis related 
      gene FKBP5 has recently been shown to be associated with varying response to 
      environmental influences and may play a role in how well people respond to 
      psychological treatments. Participants (n = 111) received exposure-based 
      cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for agoraphobia with or without panic 
      disorder, or specific phobias. Percentage DNA methylation levels were measured 
      for the promoter region and intron 7 of FKBP5. The association between percentage 
      reduction in clinical severity and change in DNA methylation was tested using 
      linear mixed models. The effect of genotype (rs1360780) was tested by the 
      inclusion of an interaction term. The association between change in DNA 
      methylation and FKBP5 expression was examined. Change in percentage DNA 
      methylation at one CpG site of intron 7 was associated with percentage reduction 
      in severity (β = -4.26, p = 3.90 × 10(-4) ), where a decrease in DNA methylation 
      was associated with greater response to therapy. An interaction was detected 
      between rs1360780 and changes in DNA methylation in the promoter region of FKBP5 
      on treatment outcome (p = .045) but did not survive correction for multiple 
      testing. Changes in DNA methylation were not associated with FKBP5 expression. 
      Decreasing DNA methylation at one CpG site of intron 7 of FKBP5 was strongly 
      associated with decreasing anxiety severity following exposure-based CBT. In 
      addition, there was suggestive evidence that allele-specific methylation at the 
      promoter region may also be associated with treatment response. The results of 
      this study add to the growing literature demonstrating the role of biological 
      processes such as DNA methylation in response to environmental influences.

TI  - What is the effect on comorbid personality disorder of brief panic-focused 
      psychotherapy in patients with panic disorder?
PG  - 239-247
LID - 10.1002/da.22708 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: No studies of psychotherapies for panic disorder (PD) have examined 
      effects on comorbid personality disorders (PersD), yet half such patients have a 
      PersD. METHODS: In a randomized trial for PD with and without agoraphobia 
      comparing Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Panic-Focused Psychodynamic 
      Psychotherapy (PFPP), PersD was assessed pre-to-post treatment with the 
      Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnosis of Axis-II Disorders (SCID-II). 
      For patients completing therapy (n = 118, 54 with PersD), covariance between 
      panic and SCID-II criteria improvements was analyzed. SCID-II diagnostic 
      remission and recovery were evaluated. Comparative efficacy of PFPP versus CBT 
      for improving PersD was analyzed both for the average patient, and as a function 
      of PersD severity. RESULTS: 37 and 17% of PersD patients experienced diagnostic 
      PersD remission and recovery, respectively. Larger reductions in PersD were 
      related to more panic improvement, with a modest effect size (r = 0.28). Although 
      there was no difference between treatments in their ability to improve PersD for 
      the average patient (d = 0.01), patients meeting more PersD criteria did better 
      in PFPP compared to CBT (P = .007), with PFPP being significantly superior at 11 
      criteria and above (d = 0.66; 3 more criteria lost). CONCLUSIONS: PersD 
      presenting in the context of primary PD rarely resolves during psychotherapies 
      focused on PD, and change in PersD only moderately tracks panic improvements, 
      indicating non-overlap of the constructs. Patients receiving panic-focused 
      psychotherapies may require additional treatment for their PersD. PFPP may be 
      superior at improving severe PersD, but replication of this finding is required.

TI  - Targeting fear of positive evaluation in patients with social anxiety disorder 
      via a brief cognitive behavioural therapy protocol: a proof-of-principle study.
PG  - 745-750
LID - 10.1017/S1352465820000491 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim was to develop a brief cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) 
      protocol to augment treatment for social anxiety disorder (SAD). This protocol 
      focused specifically upon fear of positive evaluation (FPE). To our knowledge, 
      this is the first protocol that has been designed to systematically target FPE. 
      AIMS: To test the feasibility of a brief (two-session) CBT protocol for FPE and 
      report proof-of-principle data in the form of effect sizes. METHOD: Seven 
      patients with a principal diagnosis of SAD were recruited to participate. 
      Following a pre-treatment assessment, patients were randomized to either (a) an 
      immediate CBT condition (n = 3), or (b) a comparable wait-list (WL) period (2 
      weeks; n = 4). Two WL patients also completed the CBT protocol following the WL 
      period (delayed CBT condition). Patients completed follow-up assessments 1 week 
      after completing the protocol. RESULTS: A total of five patients completed the 
      brief, FPE-specific CBT protocol (two of the seven patients were wait-listed only 
      and did not complete delayed CBT). All five patients completed the protocol and 
      provided 1-week follow-up data. CBT patients demonstrated large reductions in 
      FPE-related concerns as well as overall social anxiety symptoms, whereas WL 
      patients demonstrated an increase in FPE-related concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Our brief 
      FPE-specific CBT protocol is feasible to use and was associated with large 
      FPE-specific and social anxiety symptom reductions. To our knowledge, this is the 
      first treatment report that has focused on systematic treatment of FPE in 
      patients with SAD. Our protocol warrants further controlled evaluation.

TI  - Clinical Predictors of Response to Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy in Pediatric 
      Anxiety Disorders: The Genes for Treatment (GxT) Study.

LID - 10.1016/j.jaac.2015.03.018 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Genes for Treatment study is an international, multisite 
      collaboration exploring the role of genetic, demographic, and clinical predictors 
      in response to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in pediatric anxiety disorders. 
      The current article, the first from the study, examined demographic and clinical 
      predictors of response to CBT. We hypothesized that the child's gender, type of 
      anxiety disorder, initial severity and comorbidity, and parents' psychopathology 
      would significantly predict outcome. METHOD: A sample of 1,519 children 5 to 18 
      years of age with a primary anxiety diagnosis received CBT across 11 sites. 
      Outcome was defined as response (change in diagnostic severity) and remission 
      (absence of the primary diagnosis) at each time point (posttreatment, 3-, 6-, 
      and/or 12-month follow-up) and analyzed using linear and logistic mixed models. 
      Separate analyses were conducted using data from posttreatment and follow-up 
      assessments to explore the relative importance of predictors at these time 
      points. RESULTS: Individuals with social anxiety disorder (SoAD) had 
      significantly poorer outcomes (poorer response and lower rates of remission) than 
      those with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Although individuals with specific 
      phobia (SP) also had poorer outcomes than those with GAD at posttreatment, these 
      differences were not maintained at follow-up. Both comorbid mood and 
      externalizing disorders significantly predicted poorer outcomes at posttreatment 
      and follow-up, whereas self-reported parental psychopathology had little effect 
      on posttreatment outcomes but significantly predicted response (although not 
      remission) at follow-up. CONCLUSION: SoAD, nonanxiety comorbidity, and parental 
      psychopathology were associated with poorer outcomes after CBT. The results 
      highlight the need for enhanced treatments for children at risk for poorer 
      outcomes.

      A randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 1489-1507
LID - 10.1002/jclp.22792 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Social anxiety increases college student drop-out risk and stifles 
      employment opportunities. Group cognitive-behavioral therapy with exposure (CBT 
      ERP) has the potential to alleviate campus resource strain but remains 
      under-researched with college students. The present study investigated the 
      efficacy of group CBT ERP in a randomized clinical trial on a college campus. 
      METHOD: Thirty-one postsecondary students were randomly assigned to an 
      exposure-only group or an active control. RESULTS: Linear mixed-effects models 
      indicated significant Group × Time interactions for general social anxiety 
      (t = -2.02, g = 0.62) and depression (t = -2.77, g = 0.55); nonsignificant main 
      effects were found for group and time variables. On a measure of fear of negative 
      evaluation, only the main effect of time was significant (t = 2.15, p = 0.032). 
      CONCLUSIONS: When compared to an active control group, CBT ERP is an efficacious 
      and time-effective treatment for college students experiencing social anxiety.

TI  - Incremental benefits and cost of coordinated anxiety learning and management for 
      anxiety treatment in primary care.
PG  - 1937-48
LID - 10.1017/S0033291711002893 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improving the quality of mental health care requires integrating 
      successful research interventions into 'real-world' practice settings. 
      Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) is a treatment-delivery model 
      for anxiety disorders encountered in primary care. CALM offers cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT), medication, or both; non-expert care managers assisting 
      primary care clinicians with adherence promotion and medication optimization; 
      computer-assisted CBT delivery; and outcome monitoring. This study describes 
      incremental benefits, costs and net benefits of CALM versus usual care (UC). 
      METHOD: The CALM randomized, controlled effectiveness trial was conducted in 17 
      primary care clinics in four US cities from 2006 to 2009. Of 1062 eligible 
      patients, 1004 English- or Spanish-speaking patients aged 18-75 years with panic 
      disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD) 
      and/or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with or without major depression 
      were randomized. Anxiety-free days (AFDs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
      and expenditures for out-patient visits, emergency room (ER) visits, in-patient 
      stays and psychiatric medications were estimated based on blinded telephone 
      assessments at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months. RESULTS: Over 18 months, CALM 
      participants, on average, experienced 57.1 more AFDs [95% confidence interval 
      (CI) 31-83] and $245 additional medical expenses (95% CI $-733 to $1223). The 
      mean incremental net benefit (INB) of CALM versus UC was positive when an AFD was 
      valued ≥$4. For QALYs based on the Short-Form Health Survey-12 (SF-12) and the 
      EuroQol EQ-5D, the mean INB was positive at ≥$5000. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with 
      UC, CALM provides significant benefits with modest increases in health-care 
      expenditures.

TI  - Change in quality of life and their predictors in the long-term follow-up after 
      group cognitive behavioral therapy for social anxiety disorder: a prospective 
      cohort study.
PG  - 81
LID - 10.1186/1471-244X-10-81 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most common anxiety 
      disorders. The efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has been examined 
      but to date its effects on Quality of Life (QoL) have not been appropriately 
      evaluated especially in the long term.The study aimed to examine, in the long 
      term, what aspects of Quality of Life (QoL) changed among social anxiety disorder 
      (SAD) patients treated with group cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and what 
      predictors at baseline were associated with QoL. METHODS: Outpatients diagnosed 
      with SAD were enrolled into group CBT, and assessed at follow-ups for up to 12 
      months in a typical clinical setting. QoL was evaluated using the Short Form 36. 
      Various aspects of SAD symptomatology were also assessed. Each of the QoL domains 
      and scores on symptomatology were quantified and compared with those at baseline. 
      Baseline predictors of QoL outcomes at follow-up were investigated. RESULTS: 
      Fifty-seven outpatients were enrolled into group CBT for SAD, 48 completed the 
      whole program, and 44 and 40 completed assessments at the 3-month and 12-month 
      follow-ups, respectively. All aspects of SAD symptomatology and psychological 
      subscales of the QoL showed statistically significant improvement throughout 
      follow-ups for up to 12 months. In terms of social functioning, no statistically 
      significant improvement was observed at either follow-up point except for 
      post-treatment. No consistently significant pre-treatment predictors were 
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: After group CBT, SAD symptomatology and some aspects of 
      QoL improved and this improvement was maintained for up to 12 months, but the 
      social functioning domain did not prove any significant change statistically. 
      Considering the limited effects of CBT on QoL, especially for social functioning, 
      more powerful treatments are needed.

      randomized, controlled multicenter FMRI study.
PG  - 222-33
LID - 10.1159/000359955 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for 
      panic disorder with agoraphobia (PD/AG). It is unknown, how variants of CBT 
      differentially modulate brain networks involved in PD/AG. This study was aimed to 
      evaluate the effects of therapist-guided (T+) versus self-guided (T-) exposure on 
      the neural correlates of fear conditioning in PD/AG. METHOD: In a randomized, 
      controlled multicenter clinical trial in medication-free patients with PD/AG who 
      were treated with 12 sessions of manualized CBT, functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) was used during fear conditioning before (t1) and after CBT (t2). 
      Quality-controlled fMRI data from 42 patients and 42 healthy subjects (HS) were 
      obtained. Patients were randomized to two variants of CBT (T+, n = 22, and T-, n 
      = 20). RESULTS: The interaction of diagnosis (PD/AG, HS), treatment group (T+, 
      T-), time point (t1, t2) and stimulus type (conditioned stimulus: yes, no) 
      revealed activation in the left hippocampus and the occipitotemporal cortex. The 
      T+ group demonstrated increased activation of the hippocampus at t2 (t2 > t1), 
      which was positively correlated with treatment outcome, and a decreased 
      connectivity between the left inferior frontal gyrus and the left hippocampus 
      across time (t1 > t2). CONCLUSION: After T+ exposure, contingency-encoding 
      processes related to the posterior hippocampus are augmented and more decoupled 
      from processes of the left inferior frontal gyrus, previously shown to be 
      dysfunctionally activated in PD/AG. Linking single procedural variants to neural 
      substrates offers the potential to inform about the optimization of targeted 
      psychotherapeutic interventions.

TI  - The Cool Kids as a School-Based Universal Prevention and Early Intervention 
      Program for Anxiety: Results of a Pilot Study.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19020941 [doi]
LID - 941
AB  - The efficacy of the Cool Kids program has been consistently demonstrated both 
      within Australia and internationally, but limited data are available on the use 
      of Cool Kids as a universal program. The purpose of the study is to evaluate Cool 
      Kids as a universal program for preventing childhood anxiety in the school 
      context. There were 73 Italian children (35 boys and 36 girls, ages 10-13 years) 
      attending the last year of primary school and the first year of middle school who 
      participated in an active intervention based on a school adaptation of the Cool 
      Kids protocol. Results of t-test analyses highlighted a downward trend of anxiety 
      symptoms, especially in total anxiety, somatic anxiety, generalized anxiety, 
      separation anxiety, social anxiety and school phobia at post-treatment assessed 
      by children. Even the score of depression symptoms, measured as a second outcome 
      measure, decreased after the treatment. This study contributes to the evidence 
      base for the Cool Kids program as a universal program for preventing childhood 
      anxiety in the school context. Although these preliminary results show some 
      promise, their replication in future research is necessary given current study 
      limitations.

TI  - The therapeutic relationship in cognitive-behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy 
      for anxious youth.
PG  - 859-64
LID - 10.1037/a0033294 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the therapeutic relationship with cognitive-behavioral 
      therapists and with pharmacotherapists for youth from the Child/Adolescent 
      Anxiety Multimodal Study (Walkup et al., 2008). The therapeutic relationship was 
      examined in relation to treatment outcomes. METHOD: Participants were 488 youth 
      (ages 7-17 years; 50% male) randomized to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT; 
      Coping Cat), pharmacotherapy (sertraline), their combination, or placebo pill. 
      Participants met criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and/or 
      separation anxiety disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
      Mental Disorders (4th ed.; American Psychiatric Association, 1994). The 
      therapeutic relationship was assessed by youth report at Weeks 6 and 12 of 
      treatment using the Child's Perception of Therapeutic Relationship scale (Kendall 
      et al., 1997). Outcome measures (Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale; Research Units 
      on Pediatric Psychopharmacology Anxiety Study Group, 2002; and Clinical Global 
      Impressions Scales; Guy, 1976) were completed by independent evaluators blind to 
      condition. RESULTS: For youth who received CBT only, a stronger therapeutic 
      relationship predicted positive treatment outcome. In contrast, the therapeutic 
      relationship did not predict outcome for youth receiving sertraline, combined 
      treatment, or placebo. CONCLUSION: A therapeutic relationship may be important 
      for anxious youth who receive CBT alone.

TI  - Cognitive behavior therapy versus supportive therapy in social phobia: a 
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 137-46
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) in social phobia 
      has been demonstrated in several controlled trials and meta-analyses, but no 
      comparison of CBT with supportive therapy (ST) can be found in the literature. 
      METHOD: The aim of the trial was to study the effectiveness of CBT versus ST 
      carried out 'as usual'. Sixty-seven DSM-4 social phobic patients (89% generalized 
      subtype, most with avoidant personality) were randomly allocated into two groups. 
      Group 1 (CBT) received 8 1-hour sessions of individual cognitive therapy (CT) for 
      6 weeks, followed by 6 2-hour sessions of social skills training (SST) in group 
      weekly. Group 2 received ST for 12 weeks (6 half-hour sessions), then the 
      patients were switched to CBT. All patients agreed not to take any medication 
      during the whole trial. In group 1, 29 patients reached week 6, 27 reached week 
      12, and 24 weeks 36 and 60 (endpoint). In group 2, 29 patients reached week 6, 28 
      reached weeks 12 and 18, 26 week 24, and 23 reached weeks 48 and 72 (endpoint). 
      RESULTS: At week 6, after CT, group 1 was better than group 2 on the main social 
      phobia measure. At week 12, after SST, group 1 was better than group 2 on most of 
      the measures and demonstrated a significantly higher rate of responders. This 
      finding was replicated after switching group 2 to CBT. Sustained improvement was 
      observed in both groups at follow-up. Compliance with abstinence from medication 
      increased over time. CONCLUSIONS: CBT was more effective than ST and demonstrated 
      long-lasting effects. This may suggest that social phobia management requires 
      more than a simple and inexpensive psychological intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Learning by conditioning is a key ability of animals and humans for 
      acquiring novel behavior necessary for survival in a changing environment. 
      Aberrant conditioning has been considered a crucial factor in the etiology and 
      maintenance of panic disorder with agoraphobia (PD/A). Cognitive-behavioral 
      therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for PD/A. However, the neural mechanisms 
      underlying the effects of CBT on conditioning processes in PD/A are unknown. 
      METHODS: In a randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trial in 
      medication-free patients with PD/A who were treated with 12 sessions of 
      manualized CBT, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used during fear 
      conditioning before and after CBT. Quality-controlled fMRI data from 42 patients 
      and 42 healthy subjects were obtained. RESULTS: After CBT, patients compared to 
      control subjects revealed reduced activation for the conditioned response (CS+ > 
      CS-) in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). This activation reduction was 
      correlated with reduction in agoraphobic symptoms from t1 to t2. Patients 
      compared to control subjects also demonstrated increased connectivity between the 
      IFG and regions of the "fear network" (amygdalae, insulae, anterior cingulate 
      cortex) across time. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the link between 
      cerebral correlates of cognitive (IFG) and emotional ("fear network") processing 
      during symptom improvement across time in PD/A. Further research along this line 
      has promising potential to support the development and further optimization of 
      targeted treatments.

PG  - 119-28
LID - 10.1007/s40211-013-0065-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anorexic girls have difficulties in handling their emotions. We 
      examined emotional problems of adolescent girls with anorexia nervosa (AN) during 
      the course of cognitive behavioral group therapy (G-CBT). METHODS: Overall, 29 
      girls with AN (age 13-17 years) participated in four groups of manual based 
      G-CBT. We assessed the body mass index (BMI), eating behavior psychopathology, 
      emotions, depression, hedonistic activities, self-care and-efficacy, social 
      phobia, sense of coherence (SOC), and alexithymia before, during and up to 1 year 
      after therapy. RESULTS: Out of 29, 16 (55 %, intent to treat, or 76 %, per 
      protocol) girls were successfully treated, 5 (17 or 24 %) had a "poor outcome", 
      and 8 (28 %) dropped out. BMI, eating behavior, mood, social anxiety, self-care, 
      and self-efficacy persistently improved. Anorexic girls had multiple emotional 
      deficits, low self-confidence, and exaggerated needs of control and of being 
      accepted. Emotional deficits were resistant to change. Hedonistic activities, 
      social skills, and recovery from depression were positive, comorbid disorders and 
      parental psychopathology negative prognostic factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive preparation plays a crucial role in CBT with exposure for 
      panic disorder and agoraphobia. High emotional arousal while developing the 
      exposure rationale might impair patients' cognitive capacities for processing 
      information about treatment and impede therapeutic outcome. OBJECTIVE: This study 
      investigates whether patients' vocally encoded emotional arousal, assessed by 
      fundamental frequency (f(0)), during rationale development is associated with 
      premature treatment dropout, insight into the rationale, and symptom reduction. 
      METHODS: Patients' (N = 197, mean age 36.1 years, 79.2% female) f(0) during 
      rationale development was measured based on treatment videos from a randomized 
      controlled trial of CBT for panic disorder and agoraphobia. Insight was rater 
      assessed. Symptom severity was self- and rater assessed at the beginning and end 
      of therapy. RESULTS: Higher f(0) mean during rationale development was associated 
      with lower probability of insight and less reduction in avoidance behavior. f(0) 
      was not associated with dropout. Insight was associated with lower probability of 
      dropout and partially mediated the association between f(0) and avoidance 
      reduction. DISCUSSION: This study highlights the importance of emotional arousal 
      during cognitive preparation for exposure. Therapists should ensure that patients 
      are not too highly aroused while learning about the exposure rationale as an 
      important step in treatment.

TI  - Differential effects of adult attachment in cognitive-behavioural and 
      psychodynamic therapy in social anxiety disorder: A comparison between a 
      self-rating and an observer rating.
PG  - 373-383
LID - 10.1002/cpp.2513 [doi]
AB  - Different measures of attachment are usually weakly correlated. In a subsample of 
      an RCT comparing short-term cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and psychodynamic 
      therapy (PDT), we examined the association between attachment and outcome using 
      two attachment measures. The sample comprises 148 patients with social anxiety 
      disorder who were treated in the SOPHO-NET trial. Pretreatment attachment was 
      assessed using the Adult Attachment Prototype Rating (AAPR) and the Bielefeld 
      Questionnaire of Client Expectations (BQCE). Regression models were used to 
      predict the therapeutic alliance (HAQ) at session 8, the Liebowitz Social Anxiety 
      Scale (LSAS) at the end of therapy and a 6-month follow-up. Attachment groups 
      (secure, avoidant, and ambivalent) classified with the AAPR and the BQCE were not 
      significantly correlated (Cohen's κ = 0.08). Only the BQCE was associated with 
      the HAQ indicating avoidantly attached patients showing lower HAQ scores than 
      securely attached (Cohen's d = 0.722). Regarding the AAPR, we found an 
      interaction effect of treatment and attachment related to the post-treatment LSAS 
      scores. Post hoc tests revealed that securely attached patients in CBT had lower 
      scores than securely attached in PDT (d = 0.922) and, on a trend level, 
      avoidantly attached in CBT (d = 0.782). We conclude that attachment-outcome 
      associations are affected by the applied measure. The identified differential 
      effects suggest that psychotherapists should adapt the interventions on the 
      attachment of their patients.

TI  - Effects of parent and family characteristics on treatment outcome of anxious 
      children.
PG  - 835-48
AB  - This study examines relations between family functioning, parenting stress, 
      parental psychopathology, and treatment outcome. Participants included 61 
      children (ages 7-11 years) with features or diagnoses of separation anxiety 
      disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and/or social phobia. Treatment 
      conditions included group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and no-treatment 
      control. Higher family cohesion at baseline was associated with significantly 
      greater decreases in child anxiety at posttreatment for participants who received 
      CBT, while no association was found for the no-treatment control participants. 
      Parenting stress and parental psychopathology were not associated with treatment 
      outcome for either condition. Post hoc analyses examining relations between 
      family cohesion, parenting stress, and parental psychopathology showed that 
      parents from families low in cohesion reported significantly higher levels of 
      parenting stress and psychopathology compared to parents from families high in

TI  - In-situation safety behaviors among patients with panic disorder: descriptive and 
      correlational study.
PG  - 332-9
LID - 10.1111/pcn.12061 [doi]
AB  - AIM: In-situation safety behaviors play an important role in the maintenance of 
      anxiety because they prevent patients from experiencing unambiguous 
      disconfirmation of their unrealistic beliefs about feared catastrophes. 
      Strategies for identifying particular safety behaviors, however, have not been 
      sufficiently investigated. The aims of the present study were to (i) develop a 
      comprehensive list of safety behaviors seen in panic disorder and to examine 
      their frequency; and (ii) correlate the safety behaviors with panic attack 
      symptoms, agoraphobic situations and treatment response. METHODS: The subjects 
      consisted of 46 consecutive patients who participated in group cognitive 
      behavioral treatment (CBT) for panic disorder. All the patients completed a 
      Safety Behavior List that was developed based on experiences with panic disorder 
      patients. RESULTS: Carrying medications, distracting attention, carrying a 
      plastic bottle, and drinking water were reported by more than half of the 
      patients. The strongest correlations between panic symptoms and safety behaviors 
      were found between symptoms of derealization and listening to music with 
      headphones, paresthesia and pushing a cart while shopping, and nausea and 
      squatting down. The strongest association between agoraphobic situations and 
      safety behaviors was found between the fear of taking a bus or a train alone and 
      moving around. Staying still predicted response to the CBT program, while 
      concentrating on something predicted lack of response. CONCLUSION: An approximate 
      guideline has been developed for identifying safety behaviors among patients with 
      panic disorder and should help clinicians use CBT more effectively for these 
      patients.

TI  - The impact of depressive comorbidity on neural plasticity following 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy in panic disorder with agoraphobia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depressive disorders are a frequent comorbidity of panic disorder 
      with agoraphobia (PD/AG). Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for PD/AG 
      effectively reduces anxiety and depressive symptoms, irrespective of 
      comorbidities. However, as depressive comorbidities can confound fear circuitry 
      activation (i.e. amygdalae, insulae, anterior cingulate cortex) in PD/AG, we 
      investigated whether comorbid depressive disorders alter neural plasticity 
      following CBT. METHODS: Within a randomized, controlled clinical trial on 
      exposure-based CBT, forty-two PD/AG patients including fifteen (35.7%) with a 
      comorbid depressive disorder (PD/AG + DEP) participated in a longitudinal 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. A differential fear 
      conditioning task was used as probe of interest. A generalized 
      psycho-physiological interaction analysis (gPPI) served to study functional 
      connectivity patterns. RESULTS: After CBT, only PD/AG patients without comorbid 
      depressive disorders (PD/AG-DEP) showed reduced activation in the left inferior 
      frontal gyrus (IFG) extending to the insula. While PD/AG-DEP patients showed 
      enhanced functional connectivity (FC) between the left IFG and subcortical 
      structures (anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus and midbrain), PD/AG + DEP 
      patients exhibited increased FC between the left IFG and cortical structures 
      (prefrontal, parietal regions). In both groups, FC decreased following CBT. 
      LIMITATIONS: Primary depressed and medicated patients were excluded. Major 
      depression and dysthymia were collapsed. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced activation in the 
      left IFG, as previously shown in PD/AG, appears to be a specific substrate of CBT 
      effects in PD/AG-DEP patients only. Differential patterns of FC pertaining to 
      fear circuitry networks in patients without depression vs. cognitive networks in 
      patients with comorbid depression may point towards different pathways recruited 
      by CBT as a function of comorbidity.

TI  - A randomized trial of cognitive-behavioral therapy or selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitor or both combined for panic disorder with or without 
      agoraphobia: treatment results through 1-year follow-up.
PG  - 574-86
LID - 10.4088/JCP.08m04681blu [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the long-term effectiveness of 3 treatments for DSM-IV 
      panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), 
      pharmacotherapy using a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), or the 
      combination of both (CBT + SSRI). As a secondary objective, the relationship 
      between treatment outcome and 7 predictor variables was investigated. METHOD: 
      Patients were enrolled between April 2001 and September 2003 and were randomly 
      assigned to treatment. Academic and nonacademic clinical sites participated. Each 
      treatment modality lasted 1 year. Pharmacotherapists were free to choose between 
      5 SSRIs currently marketed in The Netherlands. Outcome was assessed after 9 
      months of treatment (posttest 1), after discontinuation of treatment (posttest 
      2), and 6 and 12 months after treatment discontinuation (follow-up 1 and 
      follow-up 2). RESULTS: In the sample (N = 150), 48% did not suffer from 
      agoraphobia or suffered from only mild agoraphobia, while 52% suffered from 
      moderate or severe agoraphobia. Patients in each treatment group improved 
      significantly from pretest to posttest 1 on the primary outcome measures of level 
      of anxiety (P < .001), degree of coping (P < .001), and remitter status (P < 
      .001), as well as on the secondary outcome measures of depressive symptomatology 
      (P < .001), and from pretest to posttest 2 for health-related quality of life (P 
      < .001). Gains were preserved from posttest 2 throughout the follow-up period. 
      Some superiority of CBT + SSRI and SSRI as compared with CBT was observed at 
      posttest 1. However, at both follow-ups, differences between treatment modalities 
      proved nonsignificant. Client satisfaction appeared to be high at treatment 
      endpoint, while patients receiving CBT + SSRI appeared slightly (P < .05) more 
      satisfied than those receiving CBT only. CONCLUSIONS: No fall-off in gains was 
      observed for either treatment modality after treatment discontinuation. SSRIs 
      were associated with adverse events. Gains produced by CBT were slower to emerge 
      than those produced by CBT + SSRI and SSRI, but CBT ended sooner. TRIAL

TI  - Brain connectomics predict response to treatment in social anxiety disorder.
PG  - 680-5
LID - 10.1038/mp.2015.109 [doi]
AB  - We asked whether brain connectomics can predict response to treatment for a 
      neuropsychiatric disorder better than conventional clinical measures. 
      Pre-treatment resting-state brain functional connectivity and diffusion-weighted 
      structural connectivity were measured in 38 patients with social anxiety disorder 
      (SAD) to predict subsequent treatment response to cognitive behavioral therapy 
      (CBT). We used a priori bilateral anatomical amygdala seed-driven resting 
      connectivity and probabilistic tractography of the right inferior longitudinal 
      fasciculus together with a data-driven multivoxel pattern analysis of whole-brain 
      resting-state connectivity before treatment to predict improvement in social 
      anxiety after CBT. Each connectomic measure improved the prediction of 
      individuals' treatment outcomes significantly better than a clinical measure of 
      initial severity, and combining the multimodal connectomics yielded a fivefold 
      improvement in predicting treatment response. Generalization of the findings was 
      supported by leave-one-out cross-validation. After dividing patients into better 
      or worse responders, logistic regression of connectomic predictors and initial 
      severity combined with leave-one-out cross-validation yielded a categorical 
      prediction of clinical improvement with 81% accuracy, 84% sensitivity and 78% 
      specificity. Connectomics of the human brain, measured by widely available 
      imaging methods, may provide brain-based biomarkers (neuromarkers) supporting 
      precision medicine that better guide patients with neuropsychiatric diseases to 
      optimal available treatments, and thus translate basic neuroimaging into medical 
      practice.

TI  - Cognitive behavioral therapy delays relapse in female socially phobic alcoholics.
PG  - 333-45
AB  - The present study was conducted to test the hypothesis that socially phobic 
      alcoholics treated with Cognitive Behavioral therapy (CBT) will have better 
      drinking outcomes than those treated with Twelve-Step Facilitation therapy (TSF). 
      Three hundred ninety-seven treatment-seeking alcoholics with concurrent social 
      phobia were compared retrospectively to a matched sample of 397 alcoholics 
      without social phobia. Treatment was delivered in an outpatient setting, and 
      patients were randomized to either CBT, TSF, or Motivational Enhancement therapy 
      (MET). The groups were compared on self-reported drinking measures (e.g., 
      quantity and frequency of drinking, and time-to-event measures) during treatment 
      period and monthly for 1 year following treatment. Survival analyses revealed 
      that female outpatients with social phobia showed delayed relapse to drinking 
      when treated with CBT rather than TSF; the reverse was true for female 
      outpatients without social phobia. Survival analyses in male outpatients with and 
      without social phobia revealed an opposite trend, though it was not statistically 
      significant. These data suggest that Cognitive Behavioral therapy is superior to 
      Twelve-Step Facilitation therapy for the treatment of alcohol problems in 
      specific populations. namely socially phobic women seeking outpatient treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent anxiety 
      disorders in the general population. The efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy 
      (CBT) for social anxiety disorders is well demonstrated. However, only three 
      studies point to the efficacy of systemic therapy (ST) in anxiety disorders, and 
      only two of them especially focus on social anxiety disorders. These ST studies 
      either do not use a good comparator but minimal supportive therapy, they do not 
      use a multi-person ST but a combined therapy, or they do not especially focus on 
      social anxiety disorders but mood and anxiety disorders in general. Though ST was 
      approved as evidence based in Germany for a variety of disorders in 2008, 
      evidence did not include anxiety disorders. This is the first pilot study that 
      will investigate multi-person ST, integrating a broad range of systemic methods, 
      specifically for social anxiety disorders and that will compare ST to the "gold 
      standard" CBT. DESIGN: This article describes the rationale and protocol of a 
      prospective, open, interventive, balanced, bi-centric, pilot randomized 
      controlled trial (RCT). A total of 32 patients with a primary SCID diagnosis of 
      social anxiety disorder will be randomized to either CBT or ST. Both treatments 
      will be manualized. The primary outcome will include social anxiety symptoms at 
      the end of therapy. Therapy will be restricted to no more than 26 hours (primary 
      endpoint). Secondary outcomes will include psychological, social systems and 
      interpersonal functioning, symptom adjustment, and caregiver burden, in addition 
      to change measures, therapist variables and treatment adherence. At the secondary 
      endpoints, 9 and 12 months after the beginning of therapy, we will again assess 
      all outcomes. DISCUSSION: The study is expected to pilot test a RCT which will be 
      the first to directly compare CBT and multi-person ST, integrating a broad range 
      of systemic methods, for social anxiety disorders, and it will provide empirical 
      evidence for the calculation of the number of patients needed for a confirmatory 
      RCT. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02360033 ; date of registration:

AB  - One of the core features of social anxiety disorder (SAD) is the persistent fear 
      of being evaluated. Fear of evaluation includes fear of negative evaluation (FNE) 
      and fear of positive evaluation (FPE). Few studies have examined the relationship 
      between self-reported FNE and FPE and neural responses to simulated negative and 
      positive social evaluation. In the current study, 56 participants, 35 with SAD 
      and 21 healthy controls, completed questionnaires to assess dimensions of social 
      anxiety including FNE and FPE, as well as symptoms of anxiety and depression. 
      Participants also completed a social evaluation task, which involved viewing 
      people delivering criticism and praise, and a control task, which involved 
      counting asterisks, during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Although 
      whole-brain analyses did not reveal significant associations between 
      self-reported constructs and neural responses to social evaluation, region of 
      interest analyses for the sample as a whole revealed that both FNE and social 
      anxiety symptoms were associated with greater neural responses to both criticism 
      and praise in emotion-processing brain regions, including the amygdala and 
      anterior insula. There were no significant associations between FPE or depressive 
      symptoms and neural responses to criticism or praise for the sample as a whole. 
      Future research should examine the relationship between FNE, FPE, and neural 
      responses to self-referent social evaluation in an unselected sample to assess a 
      full range of fear of evaluation.

TI  - Predicting treatment response in social anxiety disorder from functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging.
PG  - 87-97
LID - 10.1001/2013.jamapsychiatry.5 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Current behavioral measures poorly predict treatment outcome in social 
      anxiety disorder (SAD). To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine 
      neuroimaging-based treatment prediction in SAD. OBJECTIVE: To measure brain 
      activation in patients with SAD as a biomarker to predict subsequent response to 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). DESIGN: Functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) data were collected prior to CBT intervention. Changes in clinical status 
      were regressed on brain responses and tested for selectivity for social stimuli. 
      SETTING: Patients were treated with protocol-based CBT at anxiety disorder 
      programs at Boston University or Massachusetts General Hospital and underwent 
      neuroimaging data collection at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. PATIENTS: 
      Thirty-nine medication-free patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for the generalized 
      subtype of SAD. INTERVENTIONS: Brain responses to angry vs neutral faces or 
      emotional vs neutral scenes were examined with fMRI prior to initiation of CBT. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Whole-brain regression analyses with differential fMRI 
      responses for angry vs neutral faces and changes in Liebowitz Social Anxiety 
      Scale score as the treatment outcome measure. RESULTS: Pretreatment responses 
      significantly predicted subsequent treatment outcome of patients selectively for 
      social stimuli and particularly in regions of higher-order visual cortex. 
      Combining the brain measures with information on clinical severity accounted for 
      more than 40% of the variance in treatment response and substantially exceeded 
      predictions based on clinical measures at baseline. Prediction success was 
      unaffected by testing for potential confounding factors such as depression 
      severity at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that brain imaging can 
      provide biomarkers that substantially improve predictions for the success of 
      cognitive behavioral interventions and more generally suggest that such 
      biomarkers may offer evidence-based, personalized medicine approaches for 
      optimally selecting among treatment options for a patient.

TI  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy for panic disorder with agoraphobia in older people: 
      a comparison with younger patients.
PG  - 669-77
LID - 10.1002/da.22274 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Older adults with panic disorder and agoraphobia (PDA) are 
      underdiagnosed and undertreated, while studies of cognitive-behavioral therapy 
      (CBT) are lacking. This study compares the effectiveness of CBT for PDA in 
      younger and older adults. METHODS: A total of 172 patients with PDA (DSM-IV) 
      received manualized CBT. Primary outcome measures were avoidance behavior 
      (Mobility Inventory Avoidance scale) and agoraphobic cognitions (Agoraphobic 
      Cognitions Questionnaire), with values of the younger (18-60 years) and older (≥ 
      60 years) patients being compared using mixed linear models adjusted for baseline 
      inequalities, and predictive effects of chronological age, age at PDA onset and 
      duration of illness (DOI) being examined using multiple linear regressions. 
      RESULTS: Attrition rates were 2/31 (6%) for the over-60s and 31/141 (22%) for the 
      under-60s group (χ(2) = 3.43, df = 1, P = .06). Patients in both age groups 
      improved on all outcome measures with moderate-to-large effect sizes. Avoidance 
      behavior had improved significantly more in the 60+ group (F = 4.52, df = 1,134, 
      P = .035), with agoraphobic cognitions showing no age-related differences. 
      Baseline severity of agoraphobic avoidance and agoraphobic cognitions were the 
      most salient predictors of outcome (range standardized betas 0.59 through 0.76, 
      all P-values < .001). Apart from a superior reduction of agoraphobic avoidance in 
      the 60+ participants (β = -0.30, P = .037), chronological age was not related to 
      outcome, while in the older patients higher chronological age, late-onset type 
      and short DOI were linked to superior improvement of agoraphobic avoidance. 
      CONCLUSIONS: CBT appears feasible for 60+ PDA-patients, yielding outcomes that 
      are similar and sometimes even superior to those obtained in younger patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for 
      childhood anxiety disorders, yet a significant proportion of children do not 
      benefit from it. CBT for child anxiety disorders typically includes a range of 
      strategies that may not all be applicable for all affected children. This study 
      explored whether there are distinct subgroups of children with anxiety disorders 
      who are characterized by their responses to measures of the key mechanisms that 
      are targeted in CBT (i.e. interpretation bias, perceived control, avoidance, 
      physiological arousal, and social communication). METHODS: 379 clinically anxious 
      children (7-12 years) provided indices of threat interpretation, perceived 
      control, expected negative emotions and avoidance and measures of heart rate 
      recovery following a speech task. Parents also reported on their children's 
      social communication difficulties using the Social Communication Questionnaire 
      (SCQ). RESULTS: Latent profile analysis identified three groups, reflecting (i) 
      'Typically anxious' (the majority of the sample and more likely to have 
      Generalized anxiety disorder); (ii) 'social difficulties' (characterized by high 
      SCQ and more likely to have social anxiety disorder and be male); (iii) 
      'Avoidant' (characterized by low threat interpretation but high avoidance and low 
      perceived control). LIMITATIONS: Some measures may have been influenced by 
      confounding variables (e.g. physical variability in heart rate recovery). Sample 
      characteristics of the group may limit the generalizability of the results. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Clinically anxious children appear to fall in to subgroups that 
      might benefit from more targeted treatments that focus on specific maintenance 
      factors. Treatment studies are now required to establish whether this approach 
      would lead to more effective and efficient treatments.

TI  - A Comparison of Psychoanalytic Therapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for 
      Anxiety (Panic/Agoraphobia) and Personality Disorders (APD Study): Presentation 
      of the RCT Study Design.
PG  - 252-69
LID - 10.13109/zptm.2016.62.3.252 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Anxiety disorders, most notably panic disorders and agoraphobia, are 
      common mental disorders, and there is a high comorbidity with personality 
      disorders. Randomized controlled trails addressing this highly relevant group of 
      patients are missing. DESIGN: The multicenter Anxiety and Personality Disorders 
      (APD) study investigates 200 patients with panic disorder and/or agoraphobia with 
      comorbid personality disorder in a randomized control-group comparison of 
      psychoanalytic therapy (PT) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), including 100 
      patients in each group. Each patient will be examined over a period of six years, 
      regardless of the duration of the individual treatment. The main issues that are 
      addressed in this study are the comparison of the efficacy of PT and CBT in this 
      special patient population, the comparison of the sustainability of the effects 
      of PT and CBT, the comparison of the long-term cost-benefit-ratios of PT and CBT 
      as well as the investigation of prescriptive patient characteristics for 
      individualized treatment recommendations (differential indication). DISCUSSION: 
      The APD study compares efficacy, sustainability, and cost-benefit-ratios of CBT 
      and PT for anxiety plus personality disorders in a randomized controlled trail. 
      The study design meets the requirements for an efficacy study for PT, which were 
      recently defined. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN12449681.

TI  - Group cognitive behavioral therapy modulates the resting-state functional 
      connectivity of amygdala-related network in patients with generalized social 
      anxiety disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Amygdala is considered as the core pathogenesis of generalized social 
      anxiety disorder (GSAD). However, it is still unclear whether effective group 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) could modulate the function of 
      amygdala-related network. We aimed to examine the resting-state functional 
      connectivity (rsFC) of the amygdala before and after group CBT. METHODS: Fifteen 
      patients with GSAD were scanned on a 3T MR system before and after 8 weeks of 
      group CBT. For comparison, nineteen healthy control participants also underwent 
      baseline fMRI scanning. We used bilateral amygdala as seed regions and the rsFC 
      maps of the right and left amygdala were created separately in a voxel-wise way. 
      Clusters survived two-tailed Gaussian Random Field (GRF) correction at p <0.05 
      (voxel z value >2.3). RESULTS: Compared with baseline, patients with CBT showed 
      significantly decreased connectivity of the left amygdala with the right putamen, 
      the left dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the right dorsal anterior 
      cingulate cortex (dACC). Especially, the changes of the connectivity between the 
      left amygdala and the dACC positively correlated with changes of the anxiety 
      symptom in patients. Furthermore, in relative to controls, patients showed higher 
      connectivity of left amygdala with dmPFC and dACC at baseline, while normal after 
      CBT. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term group CBT could down-regulate the abnormal higher 
      connectivity of prefrontal-amygdala network, along with clinical improvement. 
      This may provide a potential biomarker to monitor the treatment effect of CBT in 
      GSAD patients.

TI  - A cognitive-behavioral intervention for emotion regulation in adults with 
      high-functioning autism spectrum disorders: study protocol for a randomized 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 231
LID - 10.1186/1745-6215-14-231 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adults with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have 
      difficulties in social communication; thus, these individuals have trouble 
      understanding the mental states of others. Recent research also suggests that 
      adults with ASD are unable to understand their own mental states, which could 
      lead to difficulties in emotion-regulation. Some studies have reported the 
      efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in improving emotion-regulation 
      among children with ASD. The current study will investigate the efficacy of 
      group-based CBT for adults with ASD. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a randomized, 
      waitlist controlled, single-blinded trial. The participants will be 60 adults 
      with ASD; 30 will be assigned to a CBT group and 30 to a waitlist control group. 
      Primary outcome measures are the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale, the Coping 
      Inventory for Stressful Situations, the Motion Picture Mind-Reading task, and an 
      ASD questionnaire. The secondary outcome measures are the Center for 
      Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, the World Health Organization Quality 
      of Life Scale 26-item version, the Global Assessment of Functioning, State-trait 
      Anxiety Inventory, Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory, and Liebowitz Social 
      Anxiety Scale. All will be administered during the pre- and post-intervention, 
      and 12 week follow-up periods. The CBT group will receive group therapy over an 8 
      week period (one session per week) with each session lasting approximately 100 
      minutes. Group therapy will consist of four or five adults with ASD and two 
      psychologists. We will be using visual materials for this program, mainly the 
      Cognitive Affective Training kit. DISCUSSION: This trial will hopefully indicate 
      the efficacy of group-based CBT for adults with high- functioning ASD. TRIAL 
      REGISTRATION: This trial was registered in The University Hospital Medical 
      Information Network Clinical Trials Registry No. UMIN000006236.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) is a common physical and 
      psychological disease in dental department. Pain and mandibular limitation are 
      the main reasons for patients to seek oral treatment. However, the presence of 
      kinesiophobia, patients often catastrophize pain, so as to avoid mandibular 
      movement, which seriously affects their quality of life. Cognitive behavioral 
      therapy (CBT) has significant improvements in reducing kinesiophobia and quality 
      of life in musculoskeletal disease, but has not been proved in TMD patients. The 
      study aims to apply CBT on kinesiophobia and oral health related quality of life 
      (OHRQOL) in TMD patients. METHODS: A total of 108 individuals between 18 and 65 
      years of age, who will be referred to the temporomandibular joint clinic of 
      Stomatology Hospital of Tianjin Medical University in china will be randomized 
      into 2 treatment arms. The control group will receive a conventional treatment, 
      whereas the experiment group will receive CBT on the basis of the control group. 
      The primary outcomes will be the kinesiophobia and OHRQOL, and will be measured 
      by the Tampa scale for kinesiophobia for patients with Temporomandibular 
      Disorders (TSK-TMD) and the Oral Health Impact Scale for patients with 
      temporomandibular disorders (OHIP-TMDs), the secondary outcomes will be pain 
      intensity measured by Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), pain catastrophizing measured 
      by Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), anxiety and depression measured by Hospital 
      Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and self-efficacy measured by General 
      Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES). DISCUSSION: This study protocol reported a randomized 
      controlled trial which aimed at assessing the effectiveness of the CBT versus 
      conventional treatment with TMD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered in the Chinese 
      Clinical Trial Registration Center with the number ChiCTR2000038573. Registered 
      24 September 2020.

TI  - Effects of Home-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for Depression on 
      Anxiety Symptoms among Rural, Ethnically Diverse Older Adults.
PG  - 181-190
LID - 10.1080/07317115.2017.1288670 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined the effects of home-delivered cognitive-behavioral 
      therapy (CBT) for depression on anxiety symptoms in an ethnically diverse, low 
      resource, and medically frail sample of rural, older adults. METHOD: This was a 
      secondary analysis of a randomized clincial trial with 134 rural-dwelling adults 
      65 years and older with decreased quality of life and elevated psychological 
      symptomatology. Anxiety symptoms were assessed with the anxiety and phobic 
      anxiety subscales of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). RESULTS: 
      Compared to a minimal support control condition, CBT for depression resulted in 
      significantly greater improvements in symptoms of anxiety and phobic anxiety from 
      pre-treatment to post-treatment. CONCLUSION: Home-delivered CBT for depression 
      can be an effective treatment for anxiety in a hard-to-reach older populations. 
      CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Additional research should explore integrated anxiety and 
      depression protocols and other treatment modalities, including bibliotherapy or 
      telehealth models of CBT, to reduce costs associated with its in home delivery. 
      Flexibility in administration and adaptations to the CBT protocol may be 
      necessary for use with vulnerable, rural older adults.

TI  - Effects of group experiential cognitive therapy for the treatment of panic 
      disorder with agoraphobia.
PG  - 387-93
AB  - A treatment protocol, called experiential cognitive therapy (ExCT), was 
      developed. It integrated traditional cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) with 
      virtual reality exposure for the treatment of panic disorder with agoraphobia 
      (PDA). The objective of this study was to test the efficacy of short-term (four 
      sessions) ExCT compared with a traditional 12-session panic control program (PCP) 
      for the treatment of PDA. Forty patients diagnosed as having PDA by the 
      diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV were randomly assigned to ExCT and PCP groups of 20 
      patients each. The treatment effects were measured with self-report 
      questionnaires, including the BDI, STAI, ASI, PBQ, ACQ, and BSQ. The authors also 
      assessed high end-state functioning (HES), including the success rate of stopping 
      or reducing medication at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. In all ratings, 
      both ExCT and PCP groups showed significant improvement post-treatment compared 
      with pre-treatment scores. There were no significant differences between the two 
      treatment groups in HES and medication discontinuation at post-treatment, but 
      there was a significant difference in medication discontinuation at 6-month 
      follow-up. These results suggested that although short-term effectiveness of ExCT 
      might be comparable to the effectiveness of PCP, long-term effectiveness of ExCT 
      might be relatively inferior to the effectiveness of PCP.

TI  - Predictors and moderators of treatment response in childhood anxiety disorders: 
      results from the CAMS trial.
PG  - 212-24
LID - 10.1037/a0035458 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine predictors and moderators of treatment outcomes 
      among 488 youths ages 7-17 years (50% female; 74% ≤ 12 years) meeting Diagnostic 
      and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.; American 
      Psychiatric Association, 2000) criteria for diagnoses of separation anxiety 
      disorder, social phobia, or generalized anxiety disorder who were randomly 
      assigned to receive either cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), sertraline (SRT), 
      their combination (COMB), or medication management with pill placebo (PBO) in the 
      Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS). METHOD: Six classes of 
      predictor and moderator variables (22 variables) were identified from the 
      literature and examined using continuous (Pediatric Anxiety Ratings Scale; PARS) 
      and categorical (Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement; CGI-I) outcome 
      measures. RESULTS: Three baseline variables predicted better outcomes 
      (independent of treatment condition) on the PARS, including low anxiety severity 
      (as measured by parents and independent evaluators) and caregiver strain. No 
      baseline variables were found to predict Week 12 responder status (CGI-I). 
      Participants' principal diagnosis moderated treatment outcomes but only on the 
      PARS. No baseline variables were found to moderate treatment outcomes on Week 12 
      responder status (CGI-I). DISCUSSION: Overall, anxious children responded 
      favorably to CAMS treatments. However, having more severe and impairing anxiety, 
      greater caregiver strain, and a principal diagnosis of social phobia were 
      associated with less favorable outcomes. Clinical implications of these findings 
      are discussed.

TI  - Predicting treatment response to cognitive behavioral therapy in panic disorder 
      with agoraphobia by integrating local neural information.
PG  - 68-74
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2014.1741 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Although neuroimaging research has made substantial progress in 
      identifying the large-scale neural substrate of anxiety disorders, its value for 
      clinical application lags behind expectations. Machine-learning approaches have 
      predictive potential for individual-patient prognostic purposes and might thus 
      aid translational efforts in psychiatric research. OBJECTIVE: To predict 
      treatment response to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on an individual-patient 
      level based on functional magnetic resonance imaging data in patients with panic 
      disorder with agoraphobia (PD/AG). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We included 
      49 patients free of medication for at least 4 weeks and with a primary diagnosis 
      of PD/AG in a longitudinal study performed at 8 clinical research institutes and 
      outpatient centers across Germany. The functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      study was conducted between July 2007 and March 2010. INTERVENTIONS: Twelve CBT 
      sessions conducted 2 times a week focusing on behavioral exposure. MAIN OUTCOMES 
      AND MEASURES: Treatment response was defined as exceeding a 50% reduction in 
      Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores. Blood oxygenation level-dependent signal 
      was measured during a differential fear-conditioning task. Regional and 
      whole-brain gaussian process classifiers using a nested leave-one-out 
      cross-validation were used to predict the treatment response from data acquired 
      before CBT. RESULTS: Although no single brain region was predictive of treatment 
      response, integrating regional classifiers based on data from the acquisition and 
      the extinction phases of the fear-conditioning task for the whole brain yielded 
      good predictive performance (accuracy, 82%; sensitivity, 92%; specificity, 72%; P 
      < .001). Data from the acquisition phase enabled 73% correct individual-patient 
      classifications (sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 67%; P < .001), whereas data from 
      the extinction phase led to an accuracy of 74% (sensitivity, 64%; specificity, 
      83%; P < .001). Conservative reanalyses under consideration of potential 
      confounders yielded nominally lower but comparable accuracy rates (acquisition 
      phase, 70%; extinction phase, 71%; combined, 79%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      Predicting treatment response to CBT based on functional neuroimaging data in 
      PD/AG is possible with high accuracy on an individual-patient level. This novel 
      machine-learning approach brings personalized medicine within reach, directly 
      supporting clinical decisions for the selection of treatment options, thus 
      helping to improve response rates.

TI  - Acceptance and commitment therapy for generalized social anxiety disorder: a 
      pilot study.
PG  - 543-68
AB  - Despite the demonstrated efficacy of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) for social 
      anxiety disorder (SAD), many individuals do not respond to treatment or 
      demonstrate residual symptoms and impairment posttreatment. Preliminary evidence 
      indicates that acceptance-based approaches (e.g., acceptance and commitment 
      therapy; ACT) can be helpful for a variety of disorders and emphasize 
      exposure-based strategies and processes. Nineteen individuals diagnosed with SAD 
      participated in a 12-week program integrating exposure therapy and ACT. Results 
      revealed no changes across a 4-week baseline control period. From pretreatment to 
      follow-up, significant improvements occurred in social anxiety symptoms and 
      quality of life, yielding large effect size gains. Significant changes also were 
      found in ACT-consistent process measures, and earlier changes in experiential 
      avoidance predicted later changes in symptom severity. Results suggest the 
      acceptability and potential efficacy of ACT for SAD and highlight the need for 
      future research examining both the efficacy and mechanisms of change of 
      acceptance-based programs for SAD.

TI  - Genes in treatment: Polygenic risk scores for different psychopathologies, 
      neuroticism, educational attainment and IQ and the outcome of two different 
      exposure-based fear treatments.
PG  - 699-712
LID - 10.1080/15622975.2021.1907708 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evidence for a genetic influence on psychological treatment outcome 
      so far has been inconsistent, likely due to the focus on candidate genes and the 
      heterogeneity of the disorders treated. Using polygenic risk scores (PRS) in 
      homogenous patient samples may increase the chance of detecting genetic 
      influences. METHODS: A sample of 342 phobic patients treated either for 
      clinically relevant dental fear (n = 189) or other (mixed) phobic fears (n = 153) 
      underwent highly standardised exposure-based CBT. A brief five-session format was 
      used to treat dental fear, whereas longer multi-session treatments were used with 
      the mixed-fear cohort. PRS were calculated based on large genetic studies of 
      Neuroticism, Educational Attainment (EA), Intelligence, and four psychopathology 
      domains. We compared PRS of post-treatment and follow-up remitters and 
      non-remitters and regressed PRS on fear reduction percentages. RESULTS: In the 
      dental fear cohort, EA PRS were associated with treatment outcomes, i.e. 
      drop-out, short- and long-term remission state, fear reduction, and attendance of 
      subsequent dental appointments. In the mixed fear treatment cohort, no gene 
      effects were observable. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate the importance of 
      EA-related traits for outcomes following brief, but not long, standardised 
      exposure-based CBT. Such use of PRS may help inform selection and tailoring of 
      treatments.

TI  - Does occasional cannabis use impact anxiety and depression treatment outcomes?: 
      Results from a randomized effectiveness trial.
PG  - 392-8
AB  - This study investigated the extent to which occasional cannabis use moderated 
      anxiety and depression outcomes in the Collaborative Care for Anxiety and Panic 
      (CCAP) study, a combined cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy 
      randomized effectiveness trial. Participants were 232 adults from six 
      university-based primary care outpatient clinics in three West Coast cities 
      randomized to receive either the CCAP intervention or the usual care condition. 
      Results showed significant (P<.01) evidence of an interaction between treatment 
      group (CCAP vs. usual care) and cannabis use status (monthly vs. less than 
      monthly) for depressive symptoms, but not for panic disorder or social phobia 
      symptoms (all P>.05). Monthly cannabis users' depressive symptoms improved in the 
      CCAP intervention just as much as those who used cannabis less than monthly, 
      whereas monthly users receiving usual care had significantly more depressive 
      symptoms than those using less than monthly. A combined CBT and medication 
      treatment intervention may be a promising approach for the treatment of 
      depression among occasional cannabis users.

AB  - Excessive attention toward aversive information may be a core mechanism 
      underlying emotional disorders, but little is known about whether this is 
      predictive of response to treatments. We evaluated whether enhanced attention 
      toward aversive stimuli, as indexed by an event-related potential component, the 
      late positive potential (LPP), would predict response to cognitive behavioral 
      therapy (CBT) in patients with social anxiety disorder and/or major depressive 
      disorder. Thirty-two patients receiving 12 weeks of CBT responded to 
      briefly-presented pairs of aversive and neutral pictures that served as targets 
      or distracters while electroencephaolography was recorded. Patients with larger 
      pre-treatment LPPs to aversive relative to neutral distracters (when targets were 
      aversive) were more likely to respond to CBT, and demonstrated larger reductions 
      in symptoms of depression and anxiety following treatment. Increased attention 
      toward irrelevant aversive stimuli may signal attenuated top-down control, so 
      treatments like CBT that improve this control could be beneficial for these 
      individuals.

AB  - Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (PD/A) is common and can be treated 
      effectively with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication or 
      cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT). However, the lack of access to CBT services 
      has motivated the development of self-help approaches requiring less therapist 
      contact. A novel treatment modality in this field, showing efficacy in several 
      randomized trials but until now not evaluated within the context of regular 
      psychiatric care, is Internet-based treatment. The aim of the present study was 
      to evaluate the effectiveness of Internet-based CBT for patients in a psychiatric 
      setting. Twenty consecutively referred patients with PD were included in the 
      study. A structured clinical interview with a psychiatrist was conducted for 
      inclusion, as well as at post-treatment and at the 6-month follow-up. The 
      treatment consisted of a 10-week CBT-based self-help programme, including minimal 
      therapist support by e-mail. At post-treatment, 94% of patients no longer met 
      DSM-IV criteria for PD (82% at 6-month follow-up). The within-group effect sizes 
      (for the main outcome PDSS; Panic Disorder Severity Scale) were Cohen's d=2.5 
      (pre- to post-treatment) and 2.8 (pre-treatment to follow-up), respectively. The 
      proportion of responders on the PDSS was 75% at post-treatment and 70% at 6-month 
      follow-up. The results supports earlier efficacy data on Internet-based CBT for 
      PD and indicates that it is effective also within a regular psychiatric setting. 
      However, a larger randomized controlled trial should be conducted, directly 
      comparing Internet-based CBT with traditionally administered CBT within such a 
      setting.

AB  - The fear of painful procedures is at an increased incidence within the pediatric 
      population. This can be an extremely challenging obstacle in dermatology where 
      injections, blood draws, and cryotherapy are often required during the care of 
      patients. Psychologic techniques based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can 
      be implemented leading up to and while performing these procedures to help reduce 
      patient anxiety.

AB  - In social anxiety disorder (SAD) co-morbid depressive symptoms as well as 
      avoidance behaviors have been shown to predict insufficient treatment response. 
      It is likely that subgroups of individuals with different profiles of risk 
      factors for poor treatment response exist. This study aimed to identify subgroups 
      of social avoidance and depressive symptoms in a clinical sample (N = 167) with 
      SAD before and after guided internet-delivered CBT, and to compare these groups 
      on diagnostic status and social anxiety. We further examined individual movement 
      between subgroups over time. Using cluster analysis we identified four subgroups, 
      including a high-problem cluster at both time-points. Individuals in this cluster 
      showed less remission after treatment, exhibited higher levels of social anxiety 
      at both assessments, and typically remained in the high-problem cluster after 
      treatment. Thus, in individuals with SAD, high levels of social avoidance and 
      depressive symptoms constitute a risk profile for poor treatment response.

LID - S0887-6185(17)30361-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.janxdis.2017.11.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior studies examining the effect of d-cycloserine (DCS) on homework 
      compliance and outcome in cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) have yielded mixed 
      results. The aim of this study was to investigate whether DCS facilitates the 
      effects of homework compliance on symptom reduction in a large-scale study for 
      social anxiety disorder (SAD). METHODS: 169 participants with generalized SAD 
      received DCS or pill placebo during 12-session exposure-based group CBT. 
      Improvements in social anxiety were assessed by independent raters at each 
      session using the Liebowitz social anxiety scale (LSAS). RESULTS: Controlling for 
      LSAS at the previous session, and irrespective of treatment condition, greater 
      homework compliance in the week prior related to lower LSAS at the next session. 
      However, DCS did not moderate the effect of homework compliance and LSAS, LSAS on 
      homework compliance, or the overall augmenting effect of DCS on homework 
      compliance. Furthermore, LSAS levels were not predictive of homework compliance 
      in the following week. CONCLUSION: The findings support the general benefits of 
      homework compliance on outcome, but not a DCS-augmenting effect. The comparably 
      small number of DCS-enhanced sessions in this study could be one reason for the 
      failure to find a facilitating effect of DCS.

AB  - Modifying dysfunctional emotion regulation is an important goal in psychological 
      treatments for social anxiety disorder (SAD). Antecedent-focused strategies 
      learned in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), such as cognitive reappraisal, 
      have proven more effective in reducing social anxiety than response-focused 
      strategies, such as expressive suppression. Still, not all patients with SAD 
      respond well to CBT. Medications and physiological factors may also influence the 
      clinical response. The purpose of the present study was to examine the role that 
      these factors play in determining treatment response following CBT for SAD. Using 
      multilevel modeling, we examined associations across four separate laboratory 
      visits between change in self-reported anxiety and indices of reappraisal, 
      suppression, medication status, and resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a 
      proxy measure of self-regulatory capacity, in 23 socially anxious adults during a 
      12-week program of CBT. Most participants were ultimately classified as 
      responders to CBT (n=15), but in some, anxiety levels remained unchanged (n=8). 
      Medication use explained substantial variance related to individual differences 
      in anxiety among participants. When modeled separately, reappraisal, suppression, 
      and RSA each accounted for significant variance related to anxiety. However, the 
      best-fitting model included reappraisal and RSA. Moreover, RSA reactivity (change 
      in RSA levels over time) was more important for predicting anxiety reduction than 
      were baseline levels of RSA. These findings suggest that reappraisal and 
      parasympathetic responsiveness may be important in reducing anxiety in adults 
      with SAD who respond well to CBT.

AB  - Prior work demonstrated that cognitive-behavioral (CBT) and 
      supportive-experiential (SET) group interventions can reduce dysfunctional fear 
      of progression (FoP) in patients with chronic diseases. In this secondary 
      analysis of a randomized controlled study, we investigated determinants of 
      long-term response to group therapy for FoP. Response to therapy after 12 months 
      was assessed using the Reliable Change Index (RCI). Outcome data were available 
      for 129 patients with cancer and 116 patients with chronic arthritis. 37.9% of 
      the patients in the CBT group and 32.7% of those attending the SET group 
      indicated response to therapy (p=.402). Educational level predicted long-term 
      response to therapy (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.33-4.81; p=.005). Medical patients with 
      lower education may need additional attention in order to gain long-lasting 
      benefit from brief group psychotherapy. However, this investigation needs to be 
      replicated in a study that includes a broader range of psychological predictors.

TI  - An Experimental Comparison of Techniques: Cognitive Defusion, Cognitive 
      Restructuring, and in-vivo Exposure for Social Anxiety.
PG  - 249-54
LID - 10.1017/S1352465814000630 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the primary differences between Cognitive Behavioral Therapy 
      (CBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for anxiety is the approach to 
      managing negative thoughts. CBT focuses on challenging the accuracy of 
      dysfunctional thoughts through cognitive restructuring exercises, whereas ACT 
      attempts to foster acceptance of such thoughts through cognitive defusion 
      exercises. Previous research suggests that both techniques reduce the distress 
      associated with negative thoughts, though questions remain regarding the benefit 
      of these techniques above and beyond exposure to feared stimuli. AIMS: In the 
      present study, we conducted a brief experimental intervention to examine the 
      utility of cognitive defusion + in-vivo exposure, cognitive restructuring + 
      in-vivo exposure, and in-vivo exposure alone in reducing the impact of negative 
      thoughts in patients with social anxiety disorder. METHOD: All participants 
      completed a brief public speaking exposure and those in the cognitive conditions 
      received training in the assigned cognitive technique. Participants returned a 
      week later to complete a second exposure task and self-report measures. RESULTS: 
      All three conditions resulted in similar decreases in discomfort related to 
      negative thoughts. ANOVA models failed to find an interaction between change in 
      accuracy or importance and assignment to condition in predicting decreased 
      distress of negative thoughts. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest 
      that changes in perceived importance and accuracy of negative thoughts may not be 
      the mechanisms by which cognitive defusion and cognitive restructuring affect 
      distress in the short-term.

TI  - Synchronous change in subjective and physiological reactivity during flight as an 
      indicator of treatment outcome for aviophobia: A longitudinal study with 3-year 
      follow-up.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Emotion can be seen as the organizing process that 
      coordinates response systems to deal effectively with challenges and 
      opportunities. Synchronous change in subjective and physiological reactivity is 
      regarded as an indication of this organizing process. Synchrony is expected to 
      increase with the intensity of emotional stimuli. Conversely, adaptive emotional 
      functioning could be indicated by progressive synchrony upon increasing demands, 
      and the magnitude of synchrony could be an indication of progress during therapy. 
      METHODS: We examined whether synchronous change in subjective and physiological 
      reactivity over repeated exposures increased from watching a flight video through 
      simulated flight to actual flight, and whether the magnitude of synchronous 
      change predicted favourable short- and long-term treatment outcome within a group 
      of 77 aviophobic participants during CBT. RESULTS: Results did not show a 
      relationship between the intensity of the phobic stimuli and the magnitude of 
      synchronous change in subjective and physiological reactivity. Moreover, 
      synchronous change across both response systems did not predict treatment 
      outcome. LIMITATIONS: By design this study had no control group. Additional 
      treatment or life events between end of treatment and 3-year follow-up were not 
      assessed. CONCLUSION: The results provide only weak support for the 
      functionalistic view that successful treatment of anxiety disorders is indicated 
      by synchronous change in reactivity across emotional response systems. The 
      relationship between these systems is likely to be affected by many intervening 
      variables including higher order cognitive processes.

TI  - Australian and New Zealand clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of 
      panic disorder and agoraphobia.
PG  - 641-56
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists is 
      co-ordinating the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in 
      psychiatry, funded under the National Mental Health Strategy (Australia) and the 
      New Zealand Health Funding Authority. METHOD: For these guidelines, the CPG team 
      reviewed the treatment outcome literature, consulted with practitioners and 
      patients and conducted a meta-analysis of recent outcome research. TREATMENT 
      RECOMMENDATIONS: Education for the patient and significant others covering: (i) 
      the nature and course of panic disorder and agoraphobia; (ii) an explanation of 
      the psychopathology of anxiety, panic and agoraphobia; (iii) rationale for the 
      treatment, likelihood of a positive response, and expected time frame. Cognitive 
      behaviour therapy (CBT) is more effective and more cost-effective than 
      medication. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and serotonin selective reuptake 
      inhibitors are equal in efficacy and both are to be preferred to benzodiazepines. 
      Treatment choice depends on the skill of the clinician and the patient's 
      circumstances. Drug treatment should be complemented by behaviour therapy. If the 
      response to an adequate trial of a first-line treatment is poor, another 
      evidence-based treatment should be used. A second opinion can be useful. The 
      presence of severe agoraphobia is a negative prognostic indicator, whereas 
      comorbid depression, if properly treated, has no consistent effect on outcome.

TI  - Prefrontal control and predictors of cognitive behavioral therapy response in 
      social anxiety disorder.
PG  - 630-40
LID - 10.1093/scan/nsv146 [doi]
AB  - Generalized social anxiety disorder (gSAD) is associated with aberrant anterior 
      cingulate cortex (ACC) response to threat distractors. Perceptual load has been 
      shown to modulate ACC activity such that under high load, when demands on 
      processing capacity is restricted, individuals with gSAD exhibit compensatory 
      activation to threat distractors yet under low load, there is evidence of reduced 
      activation. It is not known if neural predictors of response to cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT), based on such emotional conflict resolution, interact 
      with demands on controlled processes. Prior to CBT, 32 patients with gSAD 
      completed an fMRI task involving a target letter in a string of identical targets 
      (low perceptual load) or a target letter in a mixed letter string (high 
      perceptual load) superimposed on fearful, angry and neutral face distractors. 
      Whole-brain voxel-wise analyses revealed better CBT outcome was predicted by more 
      frontopartial activity that included dorsal ACC (dACC) and insula to threat (vs 
      neutral) distractors during high, but not low, perceptual load. 
      Psychophysiological interaction analysis with dACC as the seed region revealed 
      less connectivity with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to threat distractors 
      during high load. Results indicate patients with less regulatory capability when 
      demands on higher-order control are great may benefit more from CBT.

TI  - Beyond generalized anxiety disorder: psychometric properties of the GAD-7 in a 
      heterogeneous psychiatric sample.

LID - S0887-6185(14)00084-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.janxdis.2014.06.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although developed as a screener for Generalized Anxiety Disorder 
      (GAD) in primary care, the GAD-7 is now commonly used as a measure of general 
      anxiety symptoms across various settings and populations. However, little is 
      known about its psychometric properties when used in such heterogeneous samples. 
      We examined the internal consistency, convergent validity, sensitivity and 
      specificity, sensitivity to change, and structure of the GAD-7 in patients 
      receiving brief, intensive CBT treatment in a partial hospital setting. We also 
      examined the properties of a modified version that assessed symptoms over the 
      past 24-h. METHODS: Participants (n=1082) completed the GAD-7 upon admission and 
      discharge from a partial hospital program. They also completed measures of worry, 
      depression, and well being and a structured diagnostic interview. We examined 
      psychometric properties in the total sample and separately for patients with GAD, 
      post-traumatic stress disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), and panic 
      disorder. RESULTS: Internal consistency and convergent validity were good for the 
      total sample and each anxiety disorder group. The GAD-7 demonstrated poor 
      specificity and a high false positive rate for all anxiety disorders. Sensitivity 
      to change was generally good. Factor analysis revealed that a one-factor 
      structure did not fit the data well. The 24-h version performed similarly to the 
      original version. CONCLUSIONS: The GAD-7 performed well as a measure of anxiety 
      symptom severity, but not as a screener in this psychiatric sample. It is a 
      useful outcome measure for hetereogenous samples, but it may not perform as well 
      specifically for individuals with SAD. A modified version of the GAD-7 that 
      assessed anxiety symptoms over the past 24-h appears to be a reliable and valid 
      modification.

TI  - Cerebellar Neural Circuits Involving Executive Control Network Predict Response 
      to Group Cognitive Behavior Therapy in Social Anxiety Disorder.
PG  - 673-682

AB  - Some intrinsic connectivity networks including the default mode network (DMN) and 
      executive control network (ECN) may underlie social anxiety disorder (SAD). 
      Although the cerebellum has been implicated in the pathophysiology of SAD and 
      several networks relevant to higher-order cognition, it remains unknown whether 
      cerebellar areas involved in DMN and ECN exhibit altered resting-state functional 
      connectivity (rsFC) with cortical networks in SAD. Forty-six patients with SAD 
      and 64 healthy controls (HC) were included and submitted to the baseline 
      resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Seventeen SAD 
      patients who completed post-treatment clinical assessments were included after 
      group cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). RsFC of three cerebellar subregions in 
      both groups was assessed respectively in a voxel-wise way, and these rsFC maps 
      were compared by two-sample t tests between groups. Whole-brain voxel-wise 
      regression was performed to examine whether cerebellar connectivity networks can 
      predict response to CBT. Lower rsFC circuits of cerebellar subregions compared 
      with HC at baseline (p < 0.05, corrected by false discovery rate) were revealed. 
      The left Crus I rsFC with dorsal medial prefrontal cortex was negatively 
      correlated with symptom severity. The clinical assessments in SAD patients were 
      significantly decreased after CBT. Higher pretreatment cerebellar rsFC with 
      angular gyrus and dorsal lateral frontal cortex corresponded with greater symptom 
      improvement following CBT. Cerebellar rsFC circuits involving DMN and ECN are 
      possible neuropathologic mechanisms of SAD. Stronger pretreatment cerebellar rsFC 
      circuits involving ECN suggest potential neural markers to predict CBT response.

TI  - D-cycloserine enhancement of exposure therapy for social anxiety disorder depends 
      on the success of exposure sessions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The evidence for the efficacy of D-cycloserine (DCS) for augmenting 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders has been mixed. Guided 
      by preclinical research and initial findings from a small-scale study involving 
      humans, we tested the hypothesis that DCS enhancement of exposure therapy would 
      be specific to successful exposure sessions. METHOD: Medication-free adults with 
      generalized social anxiety disorder (N = 145) received 50 mg of DCS or placebo 1 
      h before each of 5 exposure sessions that were part of a standardized 12-session 
      group CBT protocol. Participants provided fear ratings at the beginning and just 
      before the end of exposure exercises. Independent raters, blind to group 
      assignment, administered the clinical global impression improvement and severity 
      scales at each session and at posttreatment. RESULTS: Mixed-effects analyses 
      revealed that, among patients who reported low fear at the end of an exposure 
      session, those who had received DCS evidenced significantly greater clinical 
      improvement at the next session, relative to those who had received placebo. In 
      contrast, when exposure end fear was high, patients receiving DCS exhibited less 
      clinical improvement at the following session than patients receiving placebo. 
      Similarly, patients who had received DCS evidenced lower clinical severity at 
      posttreatment, relative to patients who had received placebo, only when their 
      average end fear for medication-augmented sessions had been in the low to 
      moderate range. Finally, these moderating effects of exposure success as indexed 
      by end fear were not better accounted for by within-session extinction. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of DCS for augmenting exposure-based CBT depends on the 
      success of exposure sessions. These findings may help guide the development of an 
      algorithm for the effective use of DCS for augmenting exposure-based CBT. TRIAL

TI  - A controlled study of cognitive behaviour therapy with buspirone or placebo in 
      panic disorder with agoraphobia.
PG  - 635-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: This multicentre study compared a 16-week buspirone treatment with 
      placebo in patients presenting with panic disorder with agoraphobia and also 
      receiving cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). METHOD: Double-blind testing was 
      maintained until week 68, but not tested; 91 patients were included; 14 
      placebo-responders excluded; 77 patients randomised; 48 reached week 16 and 41 
      reached week 68. RESULTS: At week 16, within-group analysis showed significant 
      improvements in agoraphobia, panic attacks, and depression in both groups. 
      Generalised anxiety improved only in CBT+buspirone. Between-group comparisons 
      showed buspirone to have an effect on generalised anxiety and agoraphobia. 
      Changes in degree of agoraphobia and depression were correlated in subjects on 
      CBT+buspirone only. A significantly higher proportion of women, and of subjects 
      showing high avoidance dropped out. Positive expectations regarding medication 
      predicted success in both groups. At week 68, improvement was retained without 
      significant buspirone effect. CONCLUSION: Buspirone enhanced the effects of 
      cognitive behaviour therapy on generalised anxiety and agoraphobia in the short 
      term.

      and exposure-based therapy in patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia.

AB  - The gene coding for glycine receptor β subunits (GLRB) has been found to be 
      related to panic disorder and agoraphobia (PD/AG) and to be associated with 
      altered insular BOLD activation during fear conditioning, as an intermediate 
      phenotype of defensive system reactivity in healthy subjects. In a multicenter 
      clinical trial on PD/AG patients we investigated in three sub-samples whether 
      GLRB allelic variation (A/G; A-allele identified as «risk») in the single 
      nucleotide polymorphism rs7688285 was associated with autonomic (behavioral 
      avoidance test BAT; n = 267 patients) and neural (differential fear conditioning; 
      n = 49 patients, n = 38 controls) measures, and furthermore with responding 
      towards exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT, n = 184 patients). An 
      interaction of genotype with current PD/AG diagnosis (PD/AG vs. controls; fMRI 
      data only) and their modification after CBT was tested as well. Exploratory fMRI 
      results prior to CBT, revealed A-allele carriers irrespective of diagnostic 
      status to show overall higher BOLD activation in the hippocampus, motor cortex 
      (MC) and insula. Differential activation in the MC, anterior cingulate cortex 
      (ACC) and insula was found in the interaction genotype X diagnosis. Differential 
      activation in ACC and hippocampus was present in differential fear learning. ACC 
      activation was modified after treatment, while no overall rs7688285 dependent 
      effect on clinical outcomes was found. On the behavioral level, A-allele carriers 
      showed pronounced fear reactivity prior to CBT which partially normalized 
      afterwards. In sum, rs7688285 variation interacts in a complex manner with PD/AG 
      on a functional systems level and might be involved in the development of PD/AG 
      but not in their treatment.

TI  - The feasibility and acceptability of a novel anxiety in bipolar disorder 
      intervention compared to treatment as usual: A randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 953-965
LID - 10.1002/da.22781 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Comorbid anxiety is common in bipolar disorder (BD) and associated 
      with worse clinical outcomes including increased suicidality. Despite effective 
      psychological treatments for anxiety, research into treating anxiety in BD is 
      underdeveloped. This paper describes a novel psychological intervention to 
      address anxiety in context of bipolar disorder (AIBD). METHODS: Adults with BD 
      and clinically significant anxiety symptoms were randomized to AIBD plus 
      treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU alone. AIBD offered 10 sessions of psychological 
      therapy using a formulation-based approach. Feasibility and acceptability were 
      evaluated through recruitment, retention, therapy attendance, alliance, fidelity, 
      and qualitative feedback. Clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline, 16, 48, 
      and 80 weeks: interim assessments of relapse at 32 and 64 weeks. RESULTS: 
      Seventy-two participants were recruited with 88% retention to 16 weeks and 74% to 
      80 weeks (similar between arms). Therapy participants attended <mml:math 
      xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> 
      <mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>x</mml:mi> <mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover> 
      <mml:mspace/></mml:mrow> </mml:math> 7.7 (SD 2.8) sessions. Therapeutic alliance 
      and therapy fidelity were acceptable. Qualitative interviews indicated that 
      participants valued integrated support for anxiety with BD and coping strategies. 
      Some suggested a longer intervention period. Clinical outcomes were not 
      significantly different between arms up to 80 weeks follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: AIBD 
      is feasible and acceptable but lack of impact on clinical outcomes indicates that 
      adaptations are required. These are discussed in relation to qualitative feedback 
      and recent literature published since the trial completed.

TI  - Group cognitive behavior therapy for Japanese patients with social anxiety 
      disorder: preliminary outcomes and their predictors.
PG  - 69
AB  - BACKGROUND: A number of studies have provided strong evidence for the use of 
      cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in the treatment of social anxiety disorder 
      (SAD). However, all of the previous reports were from Europe and North America 
      and it is unknown whether Western psychological therapies are effective for SAD 
      in non-Western cultures. The present pilot study aimed to evaluate CBT program 
      for SAD which was originally developed for Western patients, among Japanese 
      patients. METHODS: Fifty-seven outpatients who participated in group CBT for SAD 
      were evaluated using eight self-reported and one clinician-administered 
      questionnaires to measure various aspects of SAD symptomatology at the beginning 
      and at the end of the program. Pre- and post-treatment scores were compared and 
      the magnitude of treatment effect was quantified as well based once on the 
      intention-to-treat (ITT) and once among the completers only. We also examined 
      baseline predictors of the CBT outcomes. RESULTS: Seven patients (12%) did not 
      complete the program. For the ITT sample, the percentage of reduction was 20% to 
      30% and the pre to post treatment effect sizes ranged from 0.37 to 1.01. Among 
      the completers, the respective figures were 20% to 33% and 0.41 to 1.19. We found 
      no significant pretreatment predictor of the outcomes. CONCLUSION: Group CBT for 
      SAD is acceptable and can bring about a similar degree of symptom reduction among 
      Japanese patients with SAD as among Western patients.

TI  - The revised version of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders 
      (SCARED-R): treatment sensitivity in an early intervention trial for childhood 
      anxiety disorders.
PG  - 323-36
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The revised version of the Screen for Childhood Anxiety Related 
      Emotional Disorders (SCARED-R) is a recently developed self-report questionnaire 
      for measuring DSM-IV defined anxiety disorder symptoms in children. The current 
      study examined the treatment sensitivity of the SCARED-R. METHODS: Thirty-six 
      children (aged 8-13 years) who fulfilled the criteria for generalized anxiety 
      disorder, separation anxiety disorder, and/or social phobia received either group 
      or individual cognitive-behavioural treatment. Children completed the SCARED-R 
      and a traditional measure of childhood anxiety, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory 
      for Children (STAIC), at three points in time: (1) 6 months before treatment 
      (i.e. baseline), (2) pre-treatment, and (3) post-treatment. RESULTS: Results 
      showed that children's SCARED-R and STAIC scores did not change from baseline to 
      pre-treatment, but significantly declined from pre-treatment to post-treatment. 
      An additional finding of the present study was that group and individual CBT were 
      equally effective in reducing children's anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: It can be 
      concluded that the SCARED-R reliably taps treatment effects and thus should be 
      regarded as a useful self-report index of childhood anxiety in clinical and 
      research settings. Furthermore, the data support the notion that CBT should be 
      generally regarded as an efficacious intervention for anxiety disordered 
      children.

TI  - Efficacy of the Unified Protocol for transdiagnostic treatment of comorbid 
      psychopathology accompanying emotional disorders compared to treatments targeting 
      single disorders.

LID - S0022-3956(18)30476-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2018.08.005 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine whether the Unified Protocol (UP), a 
      transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral therapy for emotional disorders (i.e., 
      anxiety, mood, and related disorders), is efficacious in the treatment of 
      co-occurring emotional disorders compared to established single disorder 
      protocols (SDPs) that target specific disorders (e.g., panic disorder). METHOD: 
      Participants included 179 adults seeking outpatient psychotherapy. Participant 
      age ranged from 18 to 66 years, with an average of 30.66 years (SD = 10.77). The 
      sample was 55% female and mostly Caucasian (83%). Diagnostic assessments were 
      completed with the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule (ADIS), and 
      disorder-specific, clinician-rated measures for the comorbid diagnoses of 
      interest. RESULTS: In both treatment conditions, participants' mean number of 
      diagnoses dropped significantly from baseline to posttreatment, and baseline to 
      12-month follow-up. Additionally, large effects were observed for changes in 
      comorbid generalized anxiety (ES(SG): UP = -1.72; SDP = -1.98), social anxiety 
      (ES(SG): UP = -1.33, -0.86; SDP = -1.60, -1.54), and depression (ES(SG): 
      UP = -0.83; SDP = -0.84). Significant differences were not observed in 
      between-group comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that both the UP and SDPs 
      are efficacious in reducing symptoms of comorbid emotional disorders. The 
      clinical, practical, and cost-effective advantages of transdiagnostic CBT are 
      discussed.

TI  - Group schema therapy versus group cognitive behavioral therapy for social anxiety 
      disorder with comorbid avoidant personality disorder: study protocol for a 
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 487
LID - 487
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) with comorbid avoidant personality 
      disorder (APD) has a high prevalence and is associated with serious psychosocial 
      problems and high societal costs. When patients suffer from both SAD and APD, the 
      Dutch multidisciplinary guidelines for personality disorders advise offering 
      prolonged cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Recently there is increasing 
      evidence for the effectiveness of schema therapy (ST) for personality disorders 
      such as borderline personality disorder and cluster C personality disorders. 
      Since ST addresses underlying personality characteristics and maladaptive coping 
      strategies developed in childhood, this treatment might be particularly effective 
      for patients with SAD and comorbid APD. To our knowledge, there are no studies 
      comparing CBT with ST in this particular group of patients. This superiority 
      trial aims at comparing the effectiveness of these treatments. As an additional 
      goal, predictors and underlying mechanisms of change will be explored. 
      METHODS/DESIGN: The design of the study is a multicentre two-group randomized 
      controlled trial (RCT) in which the treatment effect of group cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (GCBT) will be compared to that of group schema therapy (GST) 
      in a semi-open group format. A total of 128 patients aged 18-65 years old will be 
      enrolled. Patients will receive 30 sessions of GCBT or GST during a period of 
      approximately 9 months. Primary outcome measures are the Liebowitz Social Anxiety 
      Scale Self-Report (LSAS-SR) for social anxiety disorder and the newly developed 
      Avoidant Personality Disorder Severity Index (AVPDSI) for avoidant personality 
      disorder. Secondary outcome measures are the MINI section SAD, the SCID-II 
      section APD, the Schema Mode Inventory (SMI-2), the Inventory of Depressive 
      Symptomatology Self-Report (IDS-SR), the World Health Organization Quality of 
      Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), the 
      Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) and the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire 
      (AAQ-II). Data will be collected at the start, halfway and at the end of the 
      treatment, followed by measurements at 3, 6 and 12 months post-treatment. 
      DISCUSSION: The trial will increase our knowledge on the effectiveness and 
      applicability of both treatment modalities for patients suffering from both 
      diagnoses. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dutch Trial Register: NTR3921 . Registered on 25

AB  - Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by aberrant prefrontal activity 
      during reappraisal, an adaptive cognitive approach aimed at downregulating the 
      automatic response evoked by a negative event. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
      is first-line psychotherapy for SAD, however, many remain symptomatic after 
      treatment indicating baseline individual differences in neurofunctional activity 
      may factor into CBT outcome. An emotion regulation strategy practiced in CBT is 
      cognitive restructuring, a proxy for reappraisal. Therefore, neural response 
      during reappraisal may serve as a brain-based predictor of CBT success. Prior to 
      12weeks of individual CBT, 34 patients with SAD completed a validated emotion 
      regulation task during fMRI. Task instructions included 'Reappraise,' that is, 
      use a cognitive approach to reduce affective state to a negative image, which was 
      contrasted with looking at a negative image ('Look'). Regression results for 
      Reappraise (vs. Look) revealed greater reduction in symptom severity was 
      predicted by less pre-CBT activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
      (DLPFC). Regarding predictive validity, DLPFC significantly classified responder 
      status. Post-hoc analysis revealed DLPFC activity, but not demographic data, 
      baseline clinical measures, or reappraisal-related affective state during fMRI, 
      significantly accounted for the variance in symptom reduction. Findings indicate 
      patients with SAD are more likely to benefit from CBT if there is less 
      pre-treatment DLPFC recruitment, a region strongly implicated in emotion 
      regulation. Patients with reduced baseline frontal activation when reappraising 
      negative stimuli may be especially helped by explicit cognitive interventions. 
      Further research is necessary to establish DLPFC as a stable brain-based marker 
      of treatment outcome.

TI  - Partner-related attachment as a moderator of outcome in patients with social 
      anxiety disorder-a comparison between short-term cognitive-behavioral and 
      psychodynamic therapy.
PG  - 339-350
LID - 10.1037/pst0000129 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated whether partner-related attachment characteristics 
      differentially predict premature treatment termination as well as posttreatment 
      and 1-year follow-up outcome in patients with social anxiety disorder treated 
      with a manualized cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or short-term psychodynamic 
      therapy (PDT) in the SOPHO-NET (Social Phobia Psychotherapy Network) trial. 
      Participants were 412 patients with social anxiety disorder (57% female) with a 
      mean age of 35.4 years (SD = 12.1) who were randomized to either CBT or PDT. 
      Partner-related attachment characteristics were measured using the revised 
      Experiences in Close Relationships Questionnaire (ECR-R) at pretreatment. The 
      Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale was administered at pretreatment, posttreatment, 
      and a 1-year follow-up. To address our research questions, linear regression 
      models were applied. Furthermore, we compared CBT versus PDT patients within 
      ECR-R quartiles. Treatment dropout did not differ between CBT and PDT and was not 
      predicted by pretreatment attachment. In both treatment conditions, there was a 
      trend for higher attachment anxiety to be associated with a more limited 
      reduction in symptoms if controlling for pretreatment Liebowitz Social Anxiety 
      Scale scores. Exploratory analyses showed that patients assigned to the highest 
      quartile of the ECR-R-Avoidance distribution showed more benefit within the CBT 
      condition posttreatment and at follow-up than the PDT condition. Our findings 
      suggest that it may be useful to assess attachment characteristics in patients 
      with social anxiety disorder before psychotherapeutic treatment. Patients 
      characterized by very high pretreatment attachment avoidance (ECR-R-Avoidance 
      >3.87) may specifically benefit more from CBT than from PDT. However, replication 
      studies are needed that also should investigate nonlinear effects of pretreatment 
      attachment. (PsycINFO Database Record

TI  - Using Virtual Reality Environments to Augment Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for 
      Fears and Phobias in Autistic Adults.
PG  - 134-145
LID - 10.1089/aut.2018.0019 [doi]
AB  - Fears and phobias are common in people on the autism spectrum and can impact on 
      their ability to undertake usual daily activities. Graded exposure to the 
      anxiety-provoking stimulus is a recognized method of treatment for fears/phobias 
      in the nonautistic population but may pose specific difficulties for autistic 
      people. For example, real-life exposure can be too anxiety-provoking to allow 
      treatment to take place, and imaginal exposure can be problematic. To address 
      this, we developed an intervention that combines cognitive behavioral therapy 
      (CBT) with immersive virtual reality (VR) exposure to reduce anxiety. Following 
      successful trials of this intervention with young people on the autism spectrum, 
      we report a pilot study using the same intervention with autistic adults. Eight 
      adults (aged 18-57 years) received one psychoeducation session and then four 
      20-minute sessions of graded exposure with a therapist in an immersive VR room 
      (known as the Blue Room). Each participant completed all sessions showing that 
      the intervention is feasible and acceptable. Outcomes were monitored at 6 weeks 
      and 6 months postintervention. Five of the eight participants were classified as 
      intervention responders and at 6 months after the end of intervention were 
      experiencing real-life functional improvements. These preliminary findings show 
      that VR-graded exposure alongside CBT may be an effective treatment for autistic 
      people with phobias. LAY SUMMARY: Why was this study done?Anxiety is common in 
      autistic adults. For some people, fears and phobias regarding everyday objects 
      and situations occur frequently affecting everyday life. The main method to treat 
      fears and phobias for people without autism is gradual exposure to the situation 
      that causes anxiety. However, this method may be challenging for people on the 
      autism spectrum. We wanted to test a new method of treatment that uses cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered with gradual exposure in a fully immersive 
      virtual reality (VR) environment.What was the purpose of this study?We have 
      already delivered this treatment successfully with autistic children. We wanted 
      to test if this treatment would work for autistic adults. Changing traditional 
      psychological treatments, such as CBT, to make it more suitable for autistic 
      people is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care 
      Excellence.What did the researchers do?We recruited eight autistic adults (aged 
      18-57 years) with a fear/phobia and their supporter (parent/friend/support 
      worker). Each adult had one session with a therapist to learn anxiety management 
      techniques. They then had four 20-minute sessions of graded exposure with a 
      therapist in an immersive VR room (known as the Blue Room). Each participant had 
      a computer-generated scene designed for their specific anxiety-provoking 
      situation. After four sessions, the participant tried real-life exposure with 
      their supporter. We measured progress at 6 weeks and 6 months after the last VR 
      session.What were the results of this study?Each participant completed all four 
      sessions. This shows that the intervention was possible to deliver and acceptable 
      to autistic people and therapists. Participants completed assessments at 6 weeks 
      and 6 months after the VR sessions. Five of the eight participants were 
      "responders" to the intervention. This means that 6 months after the last VR 
      session, they still had real-life day-to-day improvements in relation to their 
      phobia.What do these findings add to what was already known?We had not delivered 
      this intervention to autistic adults previously. The findings show that this VR 
      intervention has the potential to be an effective treatment for anxiety in 
      autistic adults.What are the potential weaknesses in the study?This is a small 
      study and future work will be a larger trial of this treatment-comparing results 
      from people who get the intervention with people who do not. We would also want 
      to have an outcome assessor who did not know whether people had received the 
      intervention or not.How will these findings help autistic adults now or in the 
      future?This new intervention has the potential to help autistic adults manage 
      their anxiety in stressful situations and therefore may improve their quality of 
      life.

TI  - One-year follow-up of pharmacotherapy-resistant patients with panic disorder 
      treated with cognitive-behavior therapy: Outcome and predictors of remission.
PG  - 657-65
AB  - Non-response to pharmacotherapy for panic disorder (PD) is a well-documented 
      problem. However, little information exists to guide next-step strategies for 
      these non-responders. In addition to pharmacologic augmentation strategies, 
      several studies support the efficacy of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) for 
      these patients, although data on long-term outcomes has been lacking. In this 
      study, we provide one-year outcomes on a sample of 63 patients who completed 
      group CBT for PD after failing to respond adequately to previous pharmacotherapy. 
      Sustained significant benefit was found for all dimensional outcome scores, and 
      nearly two-thirds of the sample met remission criteria. This occurred with 
      reductions in medication use over the follow-up period. Negative predictors of 
      remission status included comorbid dysthymia, social phobia, and generalized 
      anxiety disorder. These results provide additional evidence for the efficacy of 
      CBT for medication non-responders with PD.

AB  - Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS-I) impacts on fear/anxiety-like behavior in 
      animals. In humans, the short (S) allele of a functional promotor polymorphism of 
      NOS1 (NOS1 ex1f-VNTR) has been shown to be associated with higher anxiety and 
      altered fear conditioning in healthy subjects in the amygdala and hippocampus 
      (AMY/HIPP). Here, we explore the role of NOS1 ex1f-VNTR as a pathophysiological 
      correlate of panic disorder and agoraphobia (PD/AG). In a sub-sample of a 
      multicenter cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) randomized controlled trial in 
      patients with PD/AG (n = 48: S/S-genotype n=15, S/L-genotype n=21, L/L-genotype 
      n=12) and healthy control subjects, HS (n = 34: S/S-genotype n=7, S/L-genotype 
      n=17, L/L-genotype=10), a differential fear conditioning and extinction 
      fMRI-paradigm was used to investigate how NOS1 ex1f-VNTR genotypes are associated 
      with differential neural activation in AMY/HIPP. Prior to CBT, L/L-allele 
      carriers showed higher activation than S/S-allele carriers in AMY/HIPP. A 
      genotype × diagnosis interaction revealed that the S-allele in HS was associated 
      with a pronounced deactivation in AMY/HIPP, while patients showed contrary 
      effects. The interaction of genotype × stimulus type (CS+, conditioned stimulus 
      associated with an aversive stimulus vs. CS-, unassociated) showed effects on 
      differential learning in AMY/HIPP. All effects were predominately found during 
      extinction. Genotype associated effects in patients were not altered after CBT. 
      Low statistical power due to small sample size in each subgroup is a major 
      limitation. However, our findings provide first preliminary evidence for 
      dysfunctional neural fear conditioning/extinction associated with NOS1 ex1f-VNTR 
      genotype in the context of PD/AG, shedding new light on the complex interaction 
      between genetic risk, current psychopathology and treatment-related effects.

TI  - A randomized, controlled trial of the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral 
      therapy and sertraline versus a waitlist control group for anxiety disorders in 
      older adults.
PG  - 255-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study is the first to investigate the relative effectiveness of 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) compared with a selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitor (SSRI; sertraline) in a randomized, controlled trial on the treatment 
      of anxiety disorders in older adults. METHOD: Eighty-four patients 60 years of 
      age and over with a principal diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, panic 
      disorder, agoraphobia, or social phobia were randomly assigned to one of three 
      conditions: 15 sessions of CBT, pharmacologic treatment with an SSRI (sertraline; 
      maximum dosage 150 mg), or a waitlist control group. Participants completed 
      measures of primary outcome (anxiety) and coexistent worry and depressive 
      symptoms at baseline, posttreatment, and at three-month follow up. RESULTS: 
      Attrition rates were high in both treatment groups. Consequently, findings are 
      based on a relatively small sample of completers (N = 52). Although both CBT and 
      sertraline led to significant improvement in anxiety, worry, and depressive 
      symptoms both at posttreatment and at three-month follow up, sertraline showed 
      superior results on worry symptoms. Effect size estimates for CBT were in the 
      small to medium range both at posttreatment (mean d = 0.42) and at three-month 
      follow up (mean d = 0.35), whereas effect sizes for sertraline fell into the 
      large range (posttreatment mean d = 0.94 and three-month follow up mean d = 
      1.02). The waitlist condition showed virtually no effects (posttreatment mean d = 
      .03). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings strongly suggest that the pharmacologic treatment 
      of late-life anxiety with SSRIs has not been given the proper attention in 
      research to date.

TI  - Disturbed circadian core body temperature rhythm and sleep disturbance in school 
      refusal children and adolescents.
PG  - 810-3
AB  - We examined the circadian rhythm of core body temperature (CBT) in 22 school 
      refusal patients, ages between 12 and 18 years, who did not have any physical or 
      psychiatric disorders, but had indefinite complaints, and were suspected to have 
      a circadian rhythm disturbance. To obtain normal data for analysis, CBT in 9 
      healthy age-matched school attendants who did not have any sleep, psychiatric, or 
      medical disturbance were monitored. Circadian variation of CBT in school refusal 
      patients did not present a clear rhythm, and appearance time of their lowest CBT 
      was markedly delayed compared to healthy subjects. Amplitude of circadian CBT 
      changes, fitted to a cosinor curve by the least square method, was significantly 
      smaller in school refusals than in healthy subjects. These findings suggest that 
      in school refusal patients who do not have physical and psychiatric disorders, 
      clinical psychosomatic symptoms (e.g., fatigue and memory disturbance) and school 
      refusal could be closely related to the desynchronization of their biorhythms, 
      particularly the circadian rhythm of body temperature and sleep-wake rhythm.

AB  - Anxiety is common in dementia and is associated with decreased independence and 
      increased risk of nursing home placement. However, little is known about the 
      treatment of anxiety in dementia. This article reports results from two patients 
      who were treated with a modified version of cognitive-behavioral therapy for 
      anxiety in dementia (CBT-AD). Modifications were made in the content, structure, 
      and learning strategies of CBT to adapt skills to the cognitive limitations of 
      these patients and include collaterals (i.e., family members, friends, or other 
      caregivers) in the treatment process. The patients received education and 
      awareness training and were taught the skills of diaphragmatic breathing, coping 
      self-statements, exposure, and behavioral activation. The Clinical Dementia 
      Rating (CDR) Scale was used to characterize dementia severity and determine 
      eligibility for treatment (a CDR score of 0.5 to 2.0 was required for 
      participation). Other measures included the Rating Anxiety in Dementia scale, the 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory Anxiety subscale, and the Mini International 
      Neuropsychiatric Interview. Outcome data showed improvement in anxiety as 
      measured by standardized rating scales. We conclude that CBT-AD is potentially 
      useful in treating anxiety in dementia patients and that this technique merits 
      further study.

LID - S2213-1582(17)30081-5 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD) 
      and other internalizing conditions attempts to improve emotion regulation. 
      Accumulating data indicate anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and to a lesser 
      extent amygdala, activation in various tasks predicts treatment outcome. However, 
      little is known about ACC and amygdala activation to emotion regulation in 
      predicting clinical improvement following CBT in SAD. METHODS: Before treatment, 
      38 SAD patients completed implicit and explicit emotion regulation paradigms 
      during fMRI. Implicit regulation involved attentional control over negative 
      distractors. Explicit regulation comprised cognitive reappraisal to negative 
      images. Pre-CBT brain activity was circumscribed to anatomical-based ACC 
      sub-regions (rostral, dorsal) and amygdala masks, which were submitted to ROC 
      curves to examine predictive validity as well as correlational analysis to 
      evaluate prognostic change in symptom severity. RESULTS: More rostral (rACC) 
      activity in implicit regulation and less rACC activity during explicit regulation 
      distinguished responders (34%) from non-responders. Greater amygdala response in 
      implicit regulation also foretold responder status. Baseline rACC and amygdala 
      activity during attentional control correlated with pre-to-post CBT change in 
      symptom severity such that more activation was related to greater decline in 
      symptoms. No significant correlations were observed for explicit regulation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Across forms of regulation, rACC activity predicted responder status 
      whereas amygdala as a neuromarker was limited to implicit regulation. While the 
      direction of effects (enhanced vs. reduced) in rACC activity was task-dependent, 
      results suggest SAD patients with deficient regulation benefited more from CBT. 
      Findings support previous studies involving patients with depression and suggest 
      the rACC may be a viable marker of clinical improvement in SAD.

AB  - We designed and pilot-tested a group-based, work-related cognitive-behavioral 
      therapy (WCBT) for unemployed individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD). 
      WCBT, delivered in a vocational service setting by vocational service 
      professionals, aims to reduce social anxiety and enable individuals to seek, 
      obtain, and retain employment. We compared WCBT to a vocational services as usual 
      control condition (VSAU). Participants were unemployed, homeless, largely African 
      American, vocational service-seeking adults with SAD (N = 58), randomized to 
      receive either eight sessions of WCBT plus VSAU or VSAU alone and followed three 
      months post-treatment. Multilevel modeling revealed significantly greater 
      reductions in social anxiety, general anxiety, depression, and functional 
      impairment for WCBT compared to VSAU. Coefficients for job search activity and 
      self-efficacy indicated greater increases for WCBT. Hours worked per week in the 
      follow-up period did not differ between the groups, but small sample size and 
      challenges associated with measuring work hours may have contributed to this 
      finding. Overall, the results of this study suggest that unemployed persons with 
      SAD can be effectively treated with specialized work-related CBT administered by 
      vocational service professionals. Future testing of WCBT with a larger sample, a 
      longer follow-up period, and adequate power to assess employment outcomes is 
      warranted.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to test the feasibility of Internet 
      interventions among nulliparous women suffering from severe fear of childbirth 
      (FOC) by means of an Internet-delivered therapist-supported self-help program 
      based on cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT). DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal 
      cohort study. SETTING: A feasibility study of an ICBT program for the treatment 
      of severe FOC in pregnant women. SAMPLE: Twenty-eight Swedish-speaking 
      nulliparous women with severe FOC recruited via a project home page from January 
      2012 to December 2013. METHODS: The main components of the ICBT program for the 
      treatment of severe FOC comprised psycho-education, breathing retraining, 
      cognitive restructuring, imaginary exposure, in vivo exposure and relapse 
      prevention. The study participants were anonymously self-recruited over the 
      Internet, interviewed by telephone and then enrolled. All participants were 
      offered 8 weeks of treatment via the Internet. Participants reported their 
      homework weekly, submitted measurements of their fear and received feedback from 
      a therapist via a secure online contact management system. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Level of FOC measured with the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire 
      (W-DEQ A) during screening at enrollment and weekly during the treatment (W-DEQ 
      version A), and after the delivery (W-DEQ version B). RESULTS: A statistically 
      significant (p < 0.0005) decrease of FOC [W-DEQ sum score decreased pre to 
      post-therapy, with a large effect size (Cohen's d = 0.95)]. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      results of this feasibility study suggest that ICBT has potential in the 
      treatment of severe FOC during pregnancy in motivated nulliparous women. The 
      results need to be confirmed by randomized controlled studies.

AB  - Increased error monitoring, as measured by the error-related negativity (ERN), 
      has been shown to persist after treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder in 
      youth and adults; however, no previous studies have examined the ERN following 
      treatment for related anxiety disorders. We used a flanker task to elicit the ERN 
      in 28 youth and young adults (8-26years old) with primary diagnoses of 
      generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or social anxiety disorder (SAD) and 35 
      healthy controls. Patients were assessed before and after treatment with 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
      (SSRI), and healthy controls were assessed at a comparable interval. The ERN 
      increased across assessments in the combined sample. Patients with SAD exhibited 
      an enhanced ERN relative to healthy controls prior to and following treatment, 
      even when analyses were limited to SAD patients who responded to treatment. 
      Patients with GAD did not significantly differ from healthy controls at either 
      assessment. Results provide preliminary evidence that enhanced error monitoring 
      persists following treatment for SAD in youth and young adults, and support 
      conceptualizations of increased error monitoring as a trait-like vulnerability 
      that may contribute to risk for recurrence and impaired functioning later in 
      life. Future work is needed to further evaluate the ERN in GAD across 
      development, including whether an enhanced ERN develops in adulthood or is most 
      apparent when worries focus on internal sources of threat.

LID - 10.1016/j.jbtep.2009.08.005 [doi]
AB  - The present study aimed to examine how video feedback can affect perceived 
      performance and anticipatory anxiety in various naturalistic social 
      anxiety-provoking situations among clinical patients diagnosed with social 
      anxiety disorder (SAD) and to examine predictors that might influence response to 
      video feedback. Participants were 52 consecutive patients with DSM-IV SAD who 
      participated in a group-based CBT program. Our results demonstrated that video 
      feedback was associated with a decrease in the underestimation of own performance 
      as well as the perception of feared outcomes. Moreover, anticipatory anxiety 
      decreased after video feedback combined with peer feedback. Male sex, comorbidity 
      with other anxiety disorders, and benzodiazepine prn, as well as patients' 
      initial anxiety and avoidance were negative predictors of the effect of video 
      feedback.

TI  - Are children with social anxiety disorder more likely than children with other 
      anxiety disorders to anticipate poor social performance and reflect negatively on 
      their performance?

LID - S0165-0327(18)31353-3 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: The cognitive theory of social anxiety disorder (SAD) suggests that 
      adults with SAD have a tendency to anticipate poor social performance and reflect 
      negatively on their performance following a social event. While a number of 
      studies with socially anxious adults have supported the role of poor performance 
      anticipation and post-event rumination in SAD, to date, only a few studies have 
      addressed whether this also applies to children with SAD. METHODS: Children (7-12 
      years) diagnosed with SAD (n = 40), other anxious children (n = 40) and 
      non-anxious children (n = 34) were exposed to a social stressor speech task and 
      their pre- and post-performance appraisals assessed, taking into account 
      objective performance ratings. RESULTS: Although observers rated some aspects of 
      performance as significantly worse among children with SAD than children with 
      other anxiety disorders, children with SAD were not more likely than their 
      anxious or non-anxious peers to show a general bias in pre- or post-performance 
      appraisals. Furthermore, children with SAD were just as likely as their anxious 
      and non-anxious peers to recognize good performance but were more critical of 
      themselves when their performance was poor. LIMITATIONS: The speech task did not 
      involve a same-age peer. Participants were relatively affluent group of 
      predominantly non-minority status. Specificity for SAD in relation to other 
      anxiety disorders remains unclear. CONCLUSIONS: Focusing on counteracting pre- 
      and post-event social performance appraisals may potentially be inappropriate for 
      childhood SAD. Children with SAD might benefit from interventions that focus on 
      helping them to become less critical of themselves after social interactions have 
      not gone well.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of Practice Team-Supported Exposure Training for Panic 
      Disorder and Agoraphobia in Primary Care: a Cluster-Randomized Trial.
PG  - 1120-1126
LID - 10.1007/s11606-020-05658-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary care is the main treatment setting for panic disorder and 
      should be supplemented by collaborative care programs. However, shortage of 
      mental health professionals prevents collaborative care programs from being 
      effectively implemented. The PARADISE study showed the efficacy of a 
      self-managed, cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)-oriented exposure training for 
      patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in primary care 
      delivered by the family practice team. OBJECTIVE: To assess the 
      cost-effectiveness of the PARADISE intervention. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness 
      analysis from the societal perspective based on data from a cluster-randomized 
      controlled trial over a time horizon of 12 months. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred 
      nineteen adult panic disorder patients with or without agoraphobia. 
      INTERVENTIONS: A self-managed, CBT-oriented exposure training for patients with 
      panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in primary care delivered by the 
      primary care practice team in comparison to routine care. MAIN MEASURES: Total 
      costs from the societal perspective. Direct costs and disease-specific costs. 
      Quality-adjusted life years based on the EQ-5D-3L. Incremental cost-effectiveness 
      ratios and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. KEY RESULTS: Patients in the 
      intervention group caused lower costs (mean, €1017; 95% confidence interval 
      [-€3306; €1272]; p = 0.38) and gained on average more QALY (mean, 0.034 QALY (95% 
      confidence interval [0.005; 0.062]; p = 0.02). Therefore, the intervention 
      dominated the control treatment. The probability of cost-effectiveness of the 
      intervention at a willingness-to-pay margin of €50,000 per QALY was 96%. Results 
      from supplementary analyses considering direct or disease-specific costs instead 
      of total costs showed comparable results. CONCLUSION: The PARADISE intervention 
      is cost effective. This conclusion is valid for total costs, generic health care 
      (direct) costs, disease-specific health care costs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German 
      Clinical Trials Register: DRKS00004386 Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN64669297.

TI  - Behavioral interventions for office-based care: stress and anxiety disorders.
PG  - 28-40
AB  - Numerous behavioral therapies have been investigated in the management of 
      anxiety- and stress-related disorders. There is strong evidence to support 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in the management of generalized anxiety 
      disorder (GAD), posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, 
      panic disorder, and social phobias. Adjunctive behavioral sleep intervention may 
      enhance results for GAD, and initiation of a selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitor for GAD before CBT also may enhance response. Several randomized 
      clinical trials showed benefit of Internet-based CBT for GAD, but additional 
      studies are needed before conclusions can be drawn regarding its effectiveness 
      for posttraumatic stress disorder. Although outcome data are limited, family 
      physicians can offer patients screening for anxiety disorders, psychological 
      first aid (ie, listening to and comforting patients, teaching about emotional and 
      physiologic responses to traumatic incidents, and encouraging engagement with 
      social supports and coping) after trauma, education about anxiety disorders, and 
      referral to evidence-based self-help resources. Family physicians also can ensure 
      linkage with behavioral health care physicians and encourage adherence to 
      self-help protocols.

TI  - Baseline heartbeat perception accuracy and short-term outcome of brief 
      cognitive-behaviour therapy for panic disorder with agoraphobia.
PG  - 426-35
LID - 10.1017/S135246581300101X [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased heartbeat perception accuracy (HBP-accuracy) may contribute 
      to the pathogenesis of Panic Disorder (PD) without or with Agoraphobia (PDA). 
      Extant research suggests that HBP-accuracy is a rather stable individual 
      characteristic, moreover predictive of worse long-term outcome in PD/PDA 
      patients. However, it remains still unexplored whether HBP-accuracy adversely 
      affects patients' short-term outcome after structured cognitive behaviour therapy 
      (CBT) for PD/PDA. AIM: To explore the potential association between HBP-accuracy 
      and the short-term outcome of a structured brief-CBT for the acute treatment of 
      PDA. METHOD: We assessed baseline HBP-accuracy using the "mental tracking" 
      paradigm in 25 consecutive medication-free, CBT-naive PDA patients. Patients then 
      underwent a structured, protocol-based, 8-session CBT by the same therapist. 
      Outcome measures included the number of panic attacks during the past week, the 
      Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire (ACQ), and the Mobility Inventory-Alone 
      subscale (MI-alone). RESULTS: No association emerged between baseline 
      HBP-accuracy and posttreatment changes concerning number of panic attacks. 
      Moreover, higher baseline HBP-accuracy was associated with significantly larger 
      reductions in the scores of the ACQ and the MI-alone scales. CONCLUSION: Our 
      results suggest that in PDA patients undergoing structured brief-CBT for the 
      acute treatment of their symptoms, higher baseline HBP-accuracy is not associated 
      with worse short-term outcome concerning panic attacks. Furthermore, higher 
      baseline HBP-accuracy may be associated with enhanced therapeutic gains in 
      agoraphobic cognitions and behaviours.

AB  - This analysis aims to identify and characterize symptom trajectories in primary 
      care patients with panic disorder with/without agoraphobia (PD/AG) who 
      participated in a primary care team based training involving elements of 
      cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Growth Mixture Modeling was used to identify 
      different latent classes of change in patients with PD/AG (N = 176) who underwent 
      treatment including CBT elements. We identified three patient classes with 
      distinct similar trajectories. Class 1 (n = 58, mean age: 46.2 years ± 13.4 
      years, 81% women) consisted of patients with an initially high symptom burden, 
      but symptoms declined constantly over the intervention period. Symptoms of 
      patients in class 2 (n = 89, mean age: 44.2 years ± 14.5 years, 67.4% women) 
      declined rapidly at the beginning, then patients went into a plateau-phase. The 
      third class (n = 29, mean age: 47.0 years ± 12.4 years, 65.5% women) was 
      characterized by an unstable course and had the worse outcome. Our findings show 
      that only a minority did not respond to the treatment. To identify this minority 
      and refer to a specialist would help patients to get intensive care in time.

TI  - Trajectories of change in anxiety severity and impairment during and after 
      treatment with evidence-based treatment for multiple anxiety disorders in primary 
      care.
PG  - 1099-106
LID - 10.1002/da.22149 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) is a model for 
      delivering evidence-based treatment for anxiety disorders in primary care. 
      Compared to usual care, CALM produced greater improvement in anxiety symptoms. 
      However, mean estimates can obscure heterogeneity in treatment response. This 
      study aimed to identify (1) clusters of participants with similar patterns of 
      change in anxiety severity and impairment (trajectory groups); and (2) 
      characteristics that predict trajectory group membership. METHODS: The CALM 
      randomized controlled effectiveness trial was conducted in 17 primary care 
      clinics in four US cities in 2006-2009. 1,004 English- or Spanish-speaking 
      patients age 18-75 with panic, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, and/or 
      posttraumatic stress disorder participated. The Overall Anxiety Severity and 
      Impairment Scale was administered repeatedly to 482 participants randomized to 
      CALM treatment. Group-based trajectory modeling was applied to identify 
      trajectory groups and multinomial logit to predict trajectory group membership. 
      RESULTS: Two predicted trajectories, representing about two-thirds of 
      participants, were below the cut-off for clinically significant anxiety a couple 
      of months after treatment initiation. The predicted trajectory for the majority 
      of remaining participants was below the cut-off by 9 months. A small group of 
      participants did not show consistent improvement. Being sicker at baseline, not 
      working, and reporting less social support were associated with less favorable 
      trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: There is heterogeneity in patient response to anxiety 
      treatment. Adverse circumstances appear to hamper treatment response. To what 
      extent anxiety symptoms improve insufficiently because adverse patient 
      circumstances contribute to suboptimal treatment delivery, suboptimal treatment 
      adherence, or suboptimal treatment response requires further investigation.

TI  - Application of the Unified Protocol for a Japanese Patient with Post-Traumatic 
      Stress Disorder and Multiple Comorbidities: A Single-Case Study.

LID - 11644
AB  - (1) Background: The efficacy of the Unified Protocol (UP), a transdiagnostic 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy, with trauma-focused exposure has not been 
      sufficiently demonstrated for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with multiple 
      comorbidities. This study examined the effects of UP treatment with 
      trauma-focused exposure on symptoms of PTSD and comorbidities in a client who was 
      hesitant about exposure. (2) Methods: The client, who had comorbid dysthymia, 
      social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and bulimia nervosa, participated in the UP 
      for 20 sessions over 6 months. The principal diagnosis and symptoms of the 
      comorbid disorders were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and at the 
      3-month follow-up. This treatment was conducted as part of a clinical study 
      (UMIN000008322). (3) Results: The client showed improvement in the principal 
      diagnosis and symptoms of the comorbid disorders post-intervention compared with 
      baseline and no longer met the diagnostic criteria for any of the disorders. 
      Considerable symptom improvement was observed with imaginal exposure to trauma 
      memories. (4) Conclusions: The UP was an effective alternative treatment for PTSD 
      and symptoms of comorbidities in this client who was hesitant about exposure to 
      traumatic memories, and that the inclusion of trauma-focused exposure provided 
      sufficient therapeutic effects. Further research is needed to examine the 
      generalizability of our findings.

LID - 10.1002/jclp.22424 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the predictive value of cognitive coping strategies at 
      pretreatment and the value of changes in these strategies during 
      cognitive-behavioral treatment for aviophobia for long-term therapy results. 
      METHOD: Data from baseline, after therapy at 2 months, short-term follow-up at 5 
      months, and long-term follow-up at 41 months were analyzed (N = 59). RESULTS: 
      Participants were in a long-term process of change, which continued positively 
      after therapy for maladaptive cognitive coping strategies. The use of cognitive 
      coping strategies at baseline was not predictive of long-term outcome. However, a 
      greater increase in the use of adaptive coping strategies, and more importantly, 
      a greater decrease in the use of maladaptive coping strategies were predictive of 
      improvements indicated in self-report of flight anxiety and actual flight 
      behavior at long-term follow-up. CONCLUSION: Improvement of maladaptive cognitive 
      coping strategies is possibly a key mechanism of change in cognitive-behavioral 
      therapy for aviophobia.

TI  - Transporting an empirically supported treatment for panic disorder to a service 
      clinic setting: a benchmarking strategy.
PG  - 231-9
AB  - This work examines the transportability of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for 
      panic disorder to a community mental health center (CMHC) setting by comparing 
      CMHC treatment outcome data with the results obtained in two controlled efficacy 
      trials. Participants were 110 clients with a primary diagnosis of panic disorder 
      with or without agoraphobia; clients were not excluded on the basis of medication 
      use or changes, severity or frequency of panic attacks, age, or the presence of 
      agoraphobia. Clients completed a 15-session CBT protocol. Despite differences in 
      settings, clients, and treatment providers, the treatment outcomes for clients 
      completing treatment in the CMHC and the efficacy studies were comparable: Of the 
      CMHC clients who completed treatment, 87% were panic-free at the end of 
      treatment, and clients showed significant reductions in anticipatory anxiety, 
      agoraphobic avoidance, generalized anxiety, and symptoms of depression. The 
      present study suggests that panic control treatment can be transported to a CMHC. 
      Challenges facing the transportability of research-based treatment to CMHC 
      clients, settings, and treatment providers are discussed.

      trial for panic disorder.
PG  - 548-55
LID - 10.1097/NMD.0b013e31817cf6f7 [doi]
AB  - A recent double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Barlow et al., 2000 JAMA. 
      283:2529-2536) examined separate and synergistic effects of psychological and 
      pharmacological treatments for panic disorder. One finding warranting further 
      investigation involved relatively high relapse rates of participants who received 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) + imipramine when compared with those 
      receiving CBT + placebo. In this article, we investigate why CBT was less 
      effective in protecting against relapse for individuals in the active drug 
      condition. We hypothesized that participants correctly deduced treatment 
      assignments and, for those taking imipramine, this was associated with the belief 
      that they were no longer taking active drug after discontinuation, accounting for 
      increased relapse rates. Contrary to hypothesis, there were no group differences 
      in frequencies of guessing drug or placebo, nor were specific beliefs about 
      taking drug or placebo differentially associated with relapse. Other possible 
      reasons for differential relapse rates and treatment implications are discussed.

TI  - Predictors of response among patients with panic disorder treated with 
      medications in a naturalistic follow-up: the role of adult separation anxiety.
PG  - 675-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jad.2011.10.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Efficacy of treatments for panic disorder is well established, but 
      not all patients respond. Adult separation anxiety has been found to predict 
      poorer response to CBT, but its effect on response to medication has not been 
      previously explored. STUDY AIM: The aim of this study is to investigate if 
      panic-agoraphobic spectrum factors, including 'separation anxiety' factor predict 
      treatment outcome in patients with panic disorder. STUDY SAMPLE: Participants who 
      met criteria for PD (n=57) completed baseline assessment and 12 months follow-up. 
      Patients were administered the Panic Agoraphobic Spectrum Self-Report (PAS-SR, 
      Lifetime and Last-Month Versions), and the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS). 
      We examined patients who met the following criteria at baseline: 1) PDSS total 
      score>7; 2) no current Axis I comorbidity with major depression; 3) no lifetime 
      or current bipolar disorder. All patients were treated with evidence-based 
      psychopharmacological treatment for panic disorder during the 12-month 
      observation period. RESULTS: Twenty eight patients (48.1%) achieved remission 
      during the follow-up period. In a logistic regression model, controlling for 
      baseline severity, gender and age, only the last-month PAS-SR 'separation 
      anxiety' factor was associated with a lower likelihood of remission. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Signs and symptoms of separation anxiety in adulthood, as assessed with the 
      PAS-SR Last Month version, are predictors of poor treatment outcome in patients 
      with PD. We submit that the assessment of panic-agoraphobic spectrum features, 
      including adult separation anxiety, should become routine of clinical assessment 
      of patients with PD. It is likely that a better psychopathological 
      characterization of patients may inform treatment selection, and result in better 
      treatment outcome.

AB  - The use of D-cycloserine (DCS) as a cognitive enhancer to augment exposure-based 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) represents a promising new translational 
      research direction with the goal to accelerate and optimize treatment response 
      for anxiety disorders. Some studies suggest that DCS may not only augment 
      extinction learning but could also facilitate fear memory reconsolidation. 
      Therefore, the effect of DCS may depend on fear levels reported at the end of 
      exposure sessions. This paper presents the rationale and design for a randomized 
      controlled trial examining the relative efficacy of tailoring DCS administration 
      based on exposure success (i.e. end fear levels) during a 5-session group CBT 
      protocol for social anxiety disorder (n = 156). Specifically, tailored 
      post-session DCS administration will be compared against untailored post-session 
      DCS, untailored pre-session DCS, and pill placebo in terms of reduction in social 
      anxiety symptoms and responder status. In addition, a subset of participants (n = 
      96) will undergo a fear extinction retention experiment prior to the clinical 
      trial in which they will be randomly assigned to receive either DCS or placebo 
      prior to extinguishing a conditioned fear. The results from this experimental 
      paradigm will clarify the mechanism of the effects of DCS on exposure procedures. 
      This study aims to serve as the first step toward developing an algorithm for the 
      personalized use of DCS during CBT for social anxiety disorder, with the ultimate 
      goal of optimizing treatment outcome for anxiety disorders.

TI  - Transfer of manualized Short Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (STPP) for social 
      phobia into clinical practice: study protocol for a cluster-randomised controlled 
      trial.
PG  - 142
LID - 10.1186/1745-6215-12-142 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychodynamic psychotherapy is frequently applied in the treatment of 
      social phobia. Nevertheless, there has been a lack of studies on the transfer of 
      manualized treatments to routine psychodynamic practice. Our study is the first 
      one to examine the effects of additional training in a manualized Short Term 
      Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (STPP) procedure on outcome in routine psychotherapy 
      for social phobia. This study is an extension to a large multi-site RCT (N = 512) 
      comparing the efficacy of STPP to Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) of Social 
      Phobia. METHODS/DESIGN: The manualized treatment is designed for a time limited 
      approach with 25 individual sessions of STPP over 6 months. Private practitioners 
      will be randomized to training in manualized STPP vs. treatment as usual without 
      a specific training (control condition). We plan to enrol a total of 105 patients 
      (84 completers). Assessments will be conducted before treatment starts, after 8 
      and 15 weeks, after 25 treatment sessions, at the end of treatment, 6 months and 
      12 months after termination of treatment. The primary outcome measure is the 
      Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Remission from social phobia is defined scoring 
      with 30 or less points on this scale. DISCUSSION: We will investigate how the 
      treatment can be transferred from a controlled trial into the less structured 
      setting of routine clinical care. This question represents Phase IV of 
      psychotherapy research. It combines the benefits of randomized controlled and 
      naturalistic research. The study is genuinely designed to promote faster and more 
      widespread dissemination of effective interventions. It will answer the questions 
      whether manualized STPP can be implemented into routine outpatient care, whether 
      the new methods improve treatment courses and outcomes and whether treatment 
      effects reached in routine psychotherapeutic treatments are comparable to those 
      of the controlled, strictly manualized treatment of the main study. TRIAL

TI  - Applying Group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Anxiety Disorders in Community 
      Settings: Retention, Outcome, and Clinical Considerations.
PG  - 117-133
LID - 10.1891/0889-8391.28.2.117 [doi]
AB  - The efficacy, and to a lesser extent, effectiveness, of individual cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders has been demonstrated, but whether 
      manualized treatments work in a group format in community settings is less 
      established. We investigated the predictors of retention and outcome in 26 groups 
      (11 Generalized Anxiety Disorder, 11 Panic, 4 Social Phobia groups), conducted 
      for more than 10 years in a semirural community mental health center by 19 
      therapists. Members of the Anxiety Disorders Treatment Team delivered manualized 
      group CBT treatments. Analysis of standard symptom measures at pre- and 
      posttreatment and archival data revealed significant pre-post decreases in 
      anxiety, retention rates comparable to past findings on group retention, and 
      several significant predictors of retention and outcome. Manualized group CBT for 
      anxiety appears to be a viable treatment in community settings. Limitations of 
      the study as well as related practice-research implications of the findings are 
      discussed.

TI  - [Analysis of the cost and the effectiveness of a psychotherapy for panic disorder 
      with agoraphobia (PDA) versus a treatment combining pharmacotherapy and 
      psychotherapy].
PG  - 201-20
AB  - Pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are efficient treatments 
      for Panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA) yet they remain expensive. This study 
      aims to compare the cost/effectiveness ratio of a CBT for PDA versus a combined 
      treatment of CBT and pharmacotherapy. Eighty-four people followed a CBT either 
      alone or combined with medication. They have been evaluated before treatment, 
      immediately after, as well as one and two years later. The therapy efficacy is 
      calculated at each assessment according to a "Global Functioning Index". Direct 
      and indirect costs are calculated with the "Health Cost Interview". Results 
      suggest that both treatments are equally effective. However, CBT alone is less 
      expensive than CBT with pharmacotherapy. Thus, it offers a better 
      cost-effectiveness ratio that even increases in the long term.

TI  - Group cognitive behavioral therapy for patients with generalized social anxiety

PG  - 267-75
LID - 10.2147/NDT.S41365 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most common psychiatric 
      disorders worldwide. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment 
      option for patients with SAD. In the present study, we examined the efficacy of 
      group CBT for patients with generalized SAD in Japan at 1-year follow-up and 
      investigated predictors with regard to outcomes. METHODS: This study was 
      conducted as a single-arm, naturalistic, follow-up study in a routine Japanese 
      clinical setting. A total of 113 outpatients with generalized SAD participated in 
      group CBT from July 2003 to August 2010 and were assessed at follow-ups for up to 
      1 year. Primary outcome was the total score on the Social Phobia Scale/Social 
      Interaction Anxiety Scale (SPS/SIAS) at 1 year. Possible baseline predictors were 
      investigated using mixed-model analyses. RESULTS: Among the 113 patients, 70 
      completed the assessment at the 1-year follow-up. The SPS/SIAS scores showed 
      significant improvement throughout the follow-ups for up to 1 year. The effect 
      sizes of SPS/SIAS at the 1-year follow-up were 0.68 (95% confidence interval 
      0.41-0.95)/0.76 (0.49-1.03) in the intention-to-treat group and 0.77 
      (0.42-1.10)/0.84 (0.49-1.18) in completers. Older age at baseline, late onset, 
      and lower severity of SAD were significantly associated with good outcomes as a 
      result of mixed-model analyses. CONCLUSIONS: CBT for patients with generalized 
      SAD in Japan is effective for up to 1 year after treatment. The effect sizes were 
      as large as those in previous studies conducted in Western countries. Older age 
      at baseline, late onset, and lower severity of SAD were predictors for a good 
      outcome from group CBT.

TI  - Cognitive-behavior therapy for discontinuation of SSRI treatment of panic 
      disorder: a case series.
PG  - 939-45
AB  - In this report we describe the outcome of eight outpatients with panic disorder 
      and agoraphobia who discontinued their treatment with a selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in the context of a structured, group program of 
      cognitive-behavior therapy. All patients successfully discontinued their SSRI 
      medication while demonstrating clinical improvement. These results were 
      maintained at 3-month follow-up. This case series suggests that manualized CBT 
      for discontinuation of benzodiazepine treatment for panic disorder may be 
      successfully applied to SSRI discontinuation as well.

TI  - No effect of CBT-based online self-help training to reduce fear of cancer 
      recurrence: First results of the CAREST multicenter randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 86-97
LID - 10.1002/pon.5233 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is a common consequence of surviving 
      cancer; therefore, easily accessible self-help training could help many cancer 
      survivors deal with FCR at low costs. The CAncer REcurrence Self-help Training 
      (CAREST) trial evaluates the effectiveness of an online-tailored self-help 
      training on the basis of evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy principles 
      in breast cancer survivors. Also, possible predictors for benefitting from the 
      online self-help training were examined. METHODS: This multicenter randomized 
      controlled trial included 262 female breast cancer survivors, randomly assigned 
      to either online self-help training (n = 130) or care as usual (CAU; n = 132). 
      Participants completed questionnaires at baseline (T0), 3 months (T1; after 
      intervention), and 9 months (T2). The primary outcome was FCR (Fear of Cancer 
      Recurrence Inventory Severity subscale). Both effectiveness and predictors were 
      analyzed with latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) according to the 
      intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: LGCM showed no differences between the 
      average latent slope in both groups (χ(2)(1)  = .23, P = .63), suggesting that 
      the treatments did not differ in their change in FCR over time. Moreover, no 
      differences were found in the effects of the predictors on the latent slope in 
      both groups (χ(2)(1)  = .12, P = .73), suggesting that no significant predictors 
      were found for the effect of the intervention on FCR. CONCLUSION: There was no 
      effect of the CBT-based online self-help training "Less fear after cancer" in the 
      current study. Therefore, we recommend adding professional support to online 
      interventions for FCR.

TI  - Social anxiety disorder. A guide for primary care physicians.
PG  - 176-8
AB  - Social anxiety disorder is prevalent, potentially disabling, but quite treatable. 
      A thorough and directed history can distinguish social phobia from depression, 
      panic disorder, and OCD. It can also screen for and identify possible substance 
      abuse. Once the diagnosis is made, a combination of pharmacologic and 
      psychotherapy is indicated. The SSRIs, MAOIs, benzodiazepines, and 
      beta-blockers--as well as CBT--can effectively treat social anxiety symptoms. 
      Primary care physicians may well want to begin by prescribing an SSRI like 
      paroxetine, along with a high potency benzodiazepine to be taken on a regular or 
      an as-needed basis, and a beta-blocker to take as needed in anticipation of 
      stressful social situations. A referral for CBT should be considered. If the 
      patient has marked side effects from drug treatment or a lack of adequate 
      response to medication, psychiatric referral is definitely indicated.

TI  - [A case report of claustrophobia with panic attack due to an MRI, treated by 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy].
PG  - 620-4
LID - 10.1016/j.revmed.2008.03.008 [doi]
AB  - Claustrophobia, this fear of being locked up without being able to escape, 
      affects about 4 to 5% of subjects in the general population. For some years, 
      studies tackle this trouble in the context of medical exam and treatments (MRI, 
      radiotherapy, etc.). Studies show that cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) 
      obtain satisfying results for treating such patients. Here, we present a case 
      report of a CBT intervention for a patient suffering from a cancer and whose 
      claustrophobia impeded her treatment.

TI  - [Cognitive behavior therapy of agoraphobia, retrospective study of 345 cases].
PG  - 300-7
AB  - Epidemiological data of 533 (42% male) agoraphobic patients referred to an 
      anxiety disorder unit are reported. Comorbidity with mood disorders was high 
      (48%). Therapeutic response was studied in 345 patients who received 
      cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT): 131 patients dropped out and 214 completed 
      treatment. At post-test 71% of the completers were improved with maintenance of 
      the gains in patients reevaluated at follow-up points ranging from 6 months to 18 
      years. Medication intake was significantly decreased. Intent to treat analysis of 
      the whole CBT sample showed that 57% of the 345 patients were improved. Drop-outs 
      were predicted by female sex and psychotic personality traits. This suggests that 
      personality assessment should be carried out in agoraphobia and therapeutic 
      interventions on personality considered in patients with disordered personality. 
      The relatively low prevalence of women in the whole sample and their higher 
      prevalence in drop-outs are discussed.
